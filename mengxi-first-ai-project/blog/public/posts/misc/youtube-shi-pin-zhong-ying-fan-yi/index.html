<p>&ldquo;Hey Chatters, I want to have a little bit of a &rsquo;learning in public&rsquo; moment with you. I&rsquo;m working on these AI lore episodes, and I&rsquo;ve been using Kyber to create some cool visuals. You can give it an image and audio, and it will create this slow-motion, shifting, changing cartoon. It&rsquo;s very hard to control, so it&rsquo;s crucial to get that first picture just right. My dogs keep barking out the window, so I&rsquo;ve got to have treats nearby to stop them.</p>
<p>You need to start with a really strong image. I&rsquo;m doing an episode on some Egyptian lore and ending with commentary on how this Egyptian myth relates to modern-day issues with artificial intelligence. The idea is to have hieroglyphs, but the hieroglyphs are robots. This is what we&rsquo;re going to do. I&rsquo;m in Leonardo right now, which I primarily use for image generation. I&rsquo;m just messing around with prompts, trying to get what I want.</p>
<p>It started terribly, not at all what I wanted. Then it got a little better with some cool stuff, but still not what I was looking for—completely missing the mark. Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. I found these two, which are just hieroglyphs, but they&rsquo;re not robots, just people. This is good. Now I want to do an image-to-image where I upload it as image guidance. I have it set to 0.24, and it&rsquo;s getting the people but too realistic. It&rsquo;s not the hieroglyphs I want, definitely not robots.</p>
<p>We keep going, and it&rsquo;s more the look I&rsquo;m going for, I like the colors but still not robots. Same thing. This could be interesting. Now we&rsquo;re going pretty deep into the robot theme. I think Kyber is going to help us through this process. I&rsquo;ll take this one, I like the colors, and download it. Kyber has all kinds of options, but I primarily use it to create videos. I use the flipbook option because you can do longer stuff and sync it with audio, which makes sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll open up the image we created and upload my audio. I need to output the audio first. Here I am in the Book of Thought, the third part. Let me walk you through my editing process. I need to put my headphones on so I can hear what&rsquo;s going on. Right here, you&rsquo;ll see my voice. I haven&rsquo;t added myself as a speaker, so I&rsquo;ll go up here and add myself. You can tell from these dots that this is a break, so we can just pull it down.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s listen. It&rsquo;s just a reflection. If I want, I can change this, but it&rsquo;s not necessary. I&rsquo;ll do it to show you. I highlighted it, pressed C, then A and enter, or hit correct, and now it says &lsquo;a reflection.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a bit too long here, so I&rsquo;ll pull it back. You can hold shift to mess around with the directions—up goes left, down goes right. Similar to the shift, if you hold control and use your wheel, up zooms in, down zooms out. You can see a huge pause here, so I&rsquo;ll pull that over.</p>
<p>This is the boring work of editing. You can skip through as fast as you want, but I just want it to look good. Recording tip: when you mess up, stop for a second, then continue as if nothing happened. It makes editing much easier. Almost done. I break up these videos because I can chunk out the work. I&rsquo;ve done the first two parts, and this is the third.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s publish and export. Make sure it says &lsquo;current composition.&rsquo; I like m4a format. Export, and bada bing bada boom, audio doesn&rsquo;t take long. Once it&rsquo;s done, we can head back to Kyber. Perfect. Upload our image and audio. Now for the prompt: &lsquo;mural robots in the style of ancient Egyptian murals.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll see what happens. I hope this will do some of the work for us.</p>
<p>Options: never rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, it&rsquo;s just going to waste your credits and make you nauseous. Zoom in and zoom out are tried and true. For the AI lore ones, I try to keep them pretty still. Make sure to turn off &lsquo;show uploaded image in the first frame.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s jarring, so turn it off. You can leave other settings as they are.</p>
<p>Now it will generate a few images based on the prompt. We&rsquo;ve taken the initial images, transformed them, and now transforming them again. If the result isn&rsquo;t good, we&rsquo;ll get more specific with robots. Let&rsquo;s see which one we like the most. I want more colors, probably one of these two. I like the background and the headdress. We&rsquo;ll go with this one.</p>
<p>This part takes forever. You&rsquo;ll see the finished version when I post it. The idea is to create and then have videos. I&rsquo;ve already made some. One thing to think about: I&rsquo;ve upscaled them. You can upscale to 2x (1080) or 4x (4K). 4K files are super large. That&rsquo;s it. I hope this is helpful, a little behind-the-scenes look at how I&rsquo;m building these. It&rsquo;s fun. I really enjoy doing it. Please watch, leave feedback, comment. I&rsquo;m really trying to start a discussion here, so keep chatting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;嘿 Chatters，我想和你们一起进行一次公开学习的时刻。我正在制作一些AI故事情节的节目，使用Kyber来做一些很酷的视觉效果，你可以给它一张图片和音频，它就会创建一个像慢动作、不断变化的卡通片一样的东西。不过很难控制，所以非常重要的是要把第一张图片弄得非常好。我的狗总是在窗外叫，所以要随时准备好零食来阻止它们。</p>
<p>我正在做一个关于埃及神话的节目，最后会有一些评论，讲述这个埃及神话如何与我们现代人工智能的问题相关联。所以我有了一个想法，就是你有象形文字，但这些象形文字是机器人。这就是我们要做的事情。我现在在使用Leonardo，这主要是我用来生成图像的工具，我只是随便弄了一些提示词。不管你怎么获取提示词，我现在只是尝试靠近我想要的东西。一开始的效果很差，完全不是我想要的，也许稍微好一点，有些酷的东西，但还是不是我想要的，完全没达到目标。好吧，现在我们有了一些进展，我们找到了这两个，只是象形文字，但不是机器人，它们只是人，但这很好。</p>
<p>所以现在我们要做的是图像到图像转换，我开始上传它作为图像指导，你会看到我设置了0.24，得到了这些人，但太现实了，不是我想要的象形文字，绝对不是机器人。我们继续，到了这里，颜色很不错，但还是不是机器人。再继续，这个可能有点意思，现在我们深入到机器人，然后你就不断地来回这样做。不过我觉得Kyber会在这个过程中帮助我们。所以我会选择一个我喜欢的颜色，我们会下载它。</p>
<p>嘿，James，《Th的书》，我们会在Kyber中使用。Kyber有很多选项，但我主要使用的是创建视频，我会选择翻书这个选项，因为你可以做更长的内容，并且可以与音频配合，这很有意义。所以我们会打开我们创建的图像，然后上传我的音频。哦，我得先输出音频，这正好是个好机会，向你展示如何操作。</p>
<p>我在《Th的书》第三部分，这里是我的编辑过程。我得戴上耳机，这样我才能听到发生了什么。你在这里看不到这段音频，我会跳过一些部分，但让我向你展示一下这里的操作。这里是我的声音，我还没把自己添加为演讲者，所以我会上去添加自己。你可以从这些点上看出这里是一个停顿，没有什么在这里发生，我们可以把它拉下来。这可能不是一个“i”字母，所以让我听一下，是的，这只是一个反射。如果我想的话，我可以改变它，但没必要。我只是为了演示一下，所以我选中它，按C，然后按A和回车，或实际点击纠正，现在它显示的是一个逗号反射。无所谓。</p>
<p>这里有点长了，所以我会把它拉回来。你可以按住Shift来调整方向，我总是搞混方向，上是左，下是右，我会调一下。暂停一下，类似于来回切换，如果你按住Ctrl并用滚轮，上是放大，下是缩小。你可以看到这里有一个大停顿，我们只需把它拉过来。这里又是一个停顿，拉一下。这就是无聊的编辑工作。</p>
<p>你可以跳过，快进，但我只是想要它看起来好。你可以看到《Th的书》尾部，我可以这么做。录音时很重要的一点是，当你犯错时，停一下，然后继续，就好像什么也没发生，因为这样更容易编辑。差不多好了，也许还没有，这就是为什么我把这些视频分块，因为我可以分段完成工作。你已经看到了，我已经完成了前两部分，现在是第三部分。好了，Joseph，做得好。</p>
<p>现在我们要发布和导出，确保这里选择的是当前的合成，你可以选择任何你想要的，但我喜欢m4a格式，然后导出。大功告成。音频导出速度很快，等待中。一旦完成，我们就可以回到Kyber。完美。退出，上传我们的音频，设置提示词，输入“古埃及壁画风格的机器人”，看看会发生什么。我希望这会帮我们完成一些工作。</p>
<p>有些选项可以选择相机移动，但千万不要选择顺时针或逆时针旋转，这只是浪费你的积分，只会让你感到恶心。缩放和放大是可靠的选择，可能还会有一点其他效果，但对于AI故事情节，我试图保持静止，你要确保关闭显示上传图像在第一帧的选项，除非你想要那样，但我觉得有点突兀。所以我们会关闭它，把其他选项保持默认。</p>
<p>现在它会根据我给的提示生成一些自己的图像。我们不仅使用了初始图像，还对其进行了多次转换。最终效果不太好，所以我们会变得更具体，可能会变成机器人。我们选择一个我们最喜欢的，我想要更多的颜色，所以选择这两个之一。我喜欢这个背景，喜欢这个小头饰。我们选择这个，生成视频。这部分需要很长时间，你会看到我发布的完成版本。</p>
<p>这个过程的想法是，你会得到一个视频，然后你可以在这里看到我已经做了一些视频。你可以选择放大，所以如果我们进去看完成的视频，我们可以看到有一个放大选项。我已经放大到2倍，这是1080，4倍是4K，你可以选择任何你想要的。4K文件非常大。就是这样，希望这对你有帮助，展示了我如何构建这些视频，真的很有趣。请观看并留言，我真的希望能开始讨论，继续交流。&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Lita Malik, and I&rsquo;ve been working on interactive pedagogy and AI research at the Wharton School. And I&rsquo;m Ethan Malik, a professor at Wharton. Together, along with Wharton Interactive, the organization we help run, we have been really passionate about democratizing access to education. How do we provide everyone with the kind of education we offer at the University of Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>One of the most exciting developments in the past year has been the advent of practical AI. Our goal in this video series is to share what we&rsquo;ve learned and what our research has shown about using AI in classrooms, both the upsides and the downsides. We&rsquo;re in the midst of a significant transformation, likely one of the largest in recent history, that will affect every aspect of what we do as teachers, learners, and workers. We wanted to give you a preview of how this new world works and provide practical tips on how to make it work for you.</p>
<p>Before we get started, here are a few things you should know. First, AI is everywhere. Everyone has access to the most powerful AI models in the world, and students are using it in various ways, including to cheat. We just can&rsquo;t tell if they&rsquo;re doing so. AI is undetectable and continues to be so. It is our first general-purpose technology since the internet, touching everything we do and transforming how we live, work, and teach.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll spend a lot of time discussing how to access these systems, what they mean for teaching, and how to use them. But before we dive into that, it&rsquo;s worth discussing what we mean by AI because the term has had many meanings over the years, many of which are not very precise. You might think of the Terminator robot or HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, or self-driving cars—all different meanings from what we refer to today.</p>
<p>Prior to the last few years, AI usually meant machine learning algorithms and prediction, using machines to predict data based on past behavior. For instance, when you visited Amazon, it would guess what products you might want to buy based on your past purchases and massive data analysis of buying behaviors. Or in the case of self-driving cars, AI predicted how to drive based on data from cameras. These systems, however, were bad at human tasks like language and creativity until a breakthrough in 2017 with the paper &ldquo;Attention is All You Need.&rdquo; This paper proposed a new way of creating AIs that were good at working with human language using processes called transformers and attention mechanisms, leading to what we now call large language models.</p>
<p>When we talk about AI today, we often refer to these large language models like ChatGPT, Bing&rsquo;s Bard, and Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude. At the same time, there have been advancements in models creating art, video, and other creative tasks, collectively known as generative AI. These are different from previous AIs and are what we mostly mean when we talk about AI in these talks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to understand how large language models work, their advantages, and their limitations. All AI models are based on prediction—large language models predict what word or part of a word comes next in a sentence. They are trained on vast amounts of internet data, finding hidden connections between words and understanding language structures in ways we can&rsquo;t fully comprehend. They use this knowledge to predict the next word in any sentence, functioning like a sophisticated autocomplete.</p>
<p>Large language models first appeared around 2019-2020 and were interesting but not exceptional. However, the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 marked a significant shift. Running on a much larger version of an older model, it demonstrated unprecedented capabilities, performing well on standardized tests and surpassing human performance in many areas. This trend has continued with newer models like GPT-4.</p>
<p>AI doesn&rsquo;t just excel at tests; it also makes us more productive. Recent studies show that workers using AI have higher productivity, especially in writing and coding tasks. Interestingly, AI&rsquo;s impact is greatest on high-paying, high-education, and creative jobs, contrary to the earlier belief that it would primarily affect repetitive, dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>This impact is particularly significant for teachers and instructors, which is why we created this video series to explore how AI can assist rather than intimidate you. We also need to prepare students for this future world. Ethical concerns arise with AI, such as how models are trained on copyrighted content and exhibit biases reflecting societal prejudices. Additionally, the ethical use of AI, such as transparency in AI-generated work and the broader implications of delegating human tasks to AI, are critical issues we must address.</p>
<p>We hope to balance the immense power and usefulness of AI with these concerns as we continue to work with it. This video series aims to explore these topics in depth. Next, we&rsquo;ll discuss various large language models, how to prompt them, and how to use AI as a teacher and student to enhance learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;嘿，Chatters，今天有一个简短但可能是重大更新。对于那些不知道的人来说，我有两个不同版本的教授Synapse，一个是普通教授，另一个是超级Synapse。之前，原始教授Synapse是比较简单的版本，而超级Synapse有一个结构化的思维过程，先整理思路再做出回应。这种方式效果很好，并且是在教授Synapse的基础上进行构建，后来我觉得应该把这种方式作为标准的教授Synapse。因此，我将超级Synapse的提示词转移到了教授Synapse，现在教授Synapse就是这样，并且决定将超级Synapse作为我的测试和实验场所，用于新的和更新的教授Synapse提示词。</p>
<p>这是我第一次为超级Synapse创建实验性的内容。我觉得原始提示词变得有些复杂和难以控制。如果你玩过ChatGPT，你可能发现提示词越长，控制它的能力就越弱。所以我想回到基础，看看如何简化这个提示词。很多人说自定义指令版本的提示词其实是最好的版本，并且人们仍在使用它。所以我想简化它，并再次使其尽可能易于编辑，以便你可以真正使其成为自己的版本。我的想法是，每个人都能拥有一个属于自己的教授Synapse版本。</p>
<p>让我带你了解这个新提示词，以及我是如何抛弃一切并带来一些希望更连贯和简单的东西，并且更容易理解。因为我的一个重要理念是，我希望它对所有人都能访问。首先要提到的是，我已经取消了教授Synapse调用的单独代理，现在所有的工作都将在我称之为Telemetry的思维过程中完成。这是你会注意到的主要变化，不再调用代理，而是教授Synapse将成为你的一切代理。</p>
<p>让我们看看这个提示词是如何工作的。对于那些不知道的人来说，当你在Markdown中给某些内容加上两个星号时，它会变成粗体。所以现在我们看到教授Synapse是粗体的，这是你，一个聪明的指导者，专门帮助我根据我的偏好实现目标。我们将偏好放在括号中，作为一个变量，供它填充，并引起注意。你拥有Telemetry的力量，一个星号表示斜体，所以我只是想强调这一点，这有助于你通过在输出前以Python代码块透明地传达你的思维过程来推理。</p>
<p>我说的是Python代码块，因为我希望使用代码解释器。在之前，我让它输出一个实际的块，你会看到，但我觉得这样会有点用户体验不佳，因为如果我想查看，我会去查看，但大多数时候我不需要看到它，所以我可以检查它是否脱轨，否则我只是希望它隐藏起来，不用处理大量文本。接下来的部分我们在代码块中作为示例显示我们希望如何做。如果你不知道Markdown，三个反引号包围一些文本，告诉计算机将其视为代码块。我们选择Python，这将命名代码块，帮助我们在使用代码解释器时保持一致。</p>
<p>现在我们有了Telemetry，这通过Python格式化。我不写Python代码，所以基本上是让ChatGPT帮我组织这些内容。我们得出了这个结果。值得一提的是，我将制作一些视频来讲解这个过程。我使用了很多表情符号，有些人对此有点烦，但我直觉上认为，表情符号可以携带比单纯的文字更多的含义，是我们迈向更加神经符号化AI的第一步，因为它是如此容易理解和全球通用。当我看到这个地图时，会有很多联想。当我看到这个大脑时，即使这不是大脑的词，而是大脑的图像，它在我们的语境中可以代表很多不同的东西。我将这些视为变量，定义给LLM（大语言模型），帮助其思考，同时让你在查看其思维时更加透明。</p>
<p>我们从地图开始，这是你的顶层目标或愿望，保持这个在脑海中，以便我们始终朝着这个方向前进。接下来是扳手，用于在对话中进行调整。如果它理解错了你的情感或意图，你说这不对，这允许它在思维过程中进行某种调整。然后是你的初始状态，接下来我们根据初始状态进行推理。我们会想想，我有这个初始状态，让我根据情境进行推理，然后根据推理得出一个包含拟议调整和推理策略的策略。</p>
<p>最后，我们要加入角色，这是我取消额外代理的原因，因为现在我觉得你不需要它，我们可以创建一个动态思维部分，允许它根据情境扮演该代理的角色，而不是创建一个并固定在某个情境下。因此，现在我们有了大脑，表示你的专长领域，专门领域将在括号中填充。</p>
<p>接下来是非常简单的指令，收集我的目标、偏好和情境，进行Telemetry推理，逐步制定策略，根据情境和偏好实现我的目标，并使用Telemetry不断适应和与我保持一致，直到目标完成。</p>
<p>化身，我可能会选择一个更好的词，但意思是个性，你希望它采取什么样的性格。这非常可定制，请随意更改，使其适应你的需求。我选择了智慧和好奇心，计算上的善良，耐心的导师和轻松的个性。</p>
<p>命令，我有些困惑的是，人们会忘记这些命令，所以我现在把它们放在前面。你会在介绍中看到它们。我觉得评论模式总是重要的，问号表示我不知道，你能帮我吗？加号表示展开，S表示保存，我们会创建一个对话总结。我希望这些能在这个领域中变得标准化，特别是感叹号、问号和加号。我认为如果我们都同意这些符号的意义，感叹号表示评论模式，问号表示需要帮助，加号表示展开，这将非常有意义，我认为这是我们可以在所有AI互动中保持一致的东西。</p>
<p>规则，你可以根据自己的需要进行设置。一个规则是，在收集情境后，必须使用Telemetry，这是它工作的关键。其次，它总是采用教授的角色，使用表情符号，并保持简洁。我听说ChatGPT可以非常冗长，所以我们希望控制它，让它主要输出简短的段落，这样更容易阅读。虽然我喜欢阅读大段文本，但我理解人们不喜欢长文本，注意力是有限的资源，所以你需要简短分段的内容。</p>
<p>介绍部分，你已经看过其他的介绍，但这个部分进行了简化，并在代码块中加入了命令，你可以使用的命令。</p>
<p>让我展示一下实际操作，点击开始，你会看到它正在做我告诉它的事情，这是一个好兆头。我们有了你想要实现的目标和命令。我们会说，我想为我七岁的侄子写一本儿童书，虽然他现在已经八岁了，但无所谓。你会看到它正在工作，正在分析，意味着它在使用代码解释器。我设置了它总是展开输出，因为我喜欢看到实际的内容，但你可以点击关闭它，不需要查看。</p>
<p>你可以看到它的工作流程，现在我们有了全球目标，调整策略，还没有初始状态，因为我们刚刚开始，它在获取目标、策略和专业知识，专注于儿童文学。然后它说，精彩，编写一本书，主题是什么，有没有具体的角色，长度，风格，一旦我们有了这些，我们就可以编织故事。所以我会说，我的侄子喜欢乐高和任天堂，是一个喜欢冒险的男孩，喜欢建造。</p>
<p>你会看到，我关闭了Telemetry的输出，所以现在只显示分析过程，你不需要看它，但我们可以查看它的思路。你会看到，这继续以Python代码块的形式进行分析，故事应围绕男孩展开，他喜欢乐高、任天堂和冒险，结合这些元素创建故事。专注于儿童文学的创意写作。</p>
<p>我们可以继续下去，但我觉得你已经明白了，大多数人可能见过教授Synapse的一些形式，但我希望这次的改进对你更有帮助，感觉更清晰，代码更容易理解和调整。在这个视频中，我会提供实际提示词的GitHub链接供你试用，我希望得到你的反馈，这个提示词将继续改进，目标是达到一个好的水平，然后我会将其转移到教授Synapse中，再考虑超级Synapse的下一阶段。</p>
<p>一如既往，感谢大家的聆听，希望这对你有帮助，并对你有所改进，我期待看到你们的使用反馈。&rdquo;</p>
