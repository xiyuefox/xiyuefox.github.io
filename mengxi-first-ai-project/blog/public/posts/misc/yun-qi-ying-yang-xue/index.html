        <p>The A–Z of foods and ingredients
In this chapter, you can look up any food or ingredient to find out whether during pregnancy and while breastfeeding it is:</p>
<pre><code>Safe to eat in normal quantities
Best avoided for safety
</code></pre>
<p> 	OK in moderation or under certain circumstances
Some items don’t have a symbol because the jury is still out. Instead, all the evidence is provided so that you can make up your own mind about whether or not you want to consume them. If you eat something and then notice later that you shouldn’t have, try not to worry: the risks are generally small (see page xiv).</p>
<p>Additives The FSA considers all additives used in the UK to be safe for consumption during pregnancy. When considering the safety of any additive, the FSA looks at the reproductive toxicity of a chemical and its ability to alter genetic material. Although the safety of individual additives is tested, there is some concern about the possible effect of consuming a combination of many different additives at the same time – the so-called ‘cocktail effect’. Another concern is that foods containing lots of additives are generally over-processed, high in fat, salt and sugar, and low in essential vitamins and minerals. Ideally you should keep foods containing additives to a minimum and instead eat plenty of unprocessed foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans and wholegrains. See also artificial sweeteners, nitrites and sulphites.</p>
<p>Almonds A good source of protein, copper, niacin, riboflavin and vitamin E. There is no need to avoid almonds unless you are allergic to them.</p>
<p>Anchovies These are an oily fish and a good source of omega 3 fatty acids, just like salmon or sardines. Cooked anchovies are fine to eat in pregnancy although you shouldn’t eat more than two portions of oily fish a week. Tinned anchovies are also safe but tend to be very salty so high intakes aren’t recommended. Marinated anchovies, bought in a sealed tub from a supermarket, should also be OK but if you are in a tapas bar, delicatessen or somewhere where you don’t feel completely confident about food storage or hygiene, then they are best avoided. The same applies to anchovies on a pizza since, although these are tinned, they may have been open for too long or stored out of the fridge.</p>
<p>Artificial sweeteners These are widely used as low-calorie or zero-calorie alternatives to sugar. Some may be considered ‘natural’ as they are extracted from leaves or sugar. All the sweeteners listed here have been evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved as safe for use in foods and drinks as part of a healthy diet. Some experts have raised concerns about the safety of using artificial sweeteners in general and in particular during pregnancy but there is no real evidence to support these claims. The EU safety assessment also checks that additives, including sweeteners, are not carcinogenic or toxic and do not pose a risk to pregnant women or children. Ideally it is better to eat unprocessed foods, and drink water rather than diet drinks, but if you are struggling to cut down on the amount of sugar you’re consuming, then having artificially sweetened foods and drinks in moderation may help.</p>
<p>Sweetener	Where found	Other information
Acesulphame K (acesulphame potassium)	Sweetener granules and tablets (e.g. Canderel). Also chewing gum, diet drinks, yogurts, puddings and salad cream.	Some controversy over use in pregnancy but no proper evidence.
Aspartame	Diet drinks, chewing gum, fat-free yogurts, cold and flu medicines.	Some controversy over use in pregnancy but no proper evidence.
It should be avoided by anyone with phenylketonuria (PKU).
Saccharin	Sweeteners such as Hermesetas and Sweetex, soft drinks, salad cream, toothpaste, vitamin supplements.	This is the most controversial of the sweeteners as it crosses the placenta into the baby’s bloodstream and remains there for some time. It is banned in Canada.
Sorbitol	Diabetic jam, chewing gum, toothpaste.	Banned from soft drinks in the EU as it has a laxative effect when consumed in large amounts.
Stevia (labelled as steviol glycosides or rebaudioside A)	Sweetener granules and tablets (e.g. Truvia and Green Canderel), soft drinks including Coca-Cola Life and reduced sugar baked beans.	 
Sucralose	Splenda (granulated and tablets), chewing gum, salad dressing, fizzy drinks.	 
Xylatol	Toothpaste, chewing gum.	Banned from soft drinks in the EU as it has a laxative effect when consumed in large amounts.
Bananas A good healthy snack to have if energy levels drop when you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Some women find that bananas cause heartburn, but otherwise there’s no need to avoid them.</p>
<p>Barbecued food Make sure all meat, burgers, sausages, fish, etc. are cooked properly, otherwise there is a risk of food poisoning. Even if something looks cooked on the outside, check that it’s piping hot in the centre. Also, try to avoid heavily charred food: the cooking process produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HAs), including some carcinogenic chemicals that could be harmful during pregnancy. It is best to keep your intake to a minimum, though no safe level has been established. At barbecues, it’s also important to check that salads have been washed thoroughly and to steer clear of food that’s been sitting outside for a long time, because food poisoning bugs multiply rapidly in warm weather.</p>
<p>Basil This is safe to eat in normal amounts. However, it is one of several herbs that act as a uterine stimulant when concentrated or used in very large amounts. Therefore you should avoid using basil oil (commonly used for aromatherapy) during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Bean sprouts You should avoid eating raw bean sprouts during pregnancy because of the risk of salmonella. If you want to eat them they should be heated thoroughly until piping hot. This includes those labelled as ‘ready to eat’. The FSA issued this advice in 2010 after more than 100 cases of Salmonella Bareilly were found with possible links to raw bean sprouts.</p>
<p>Béarnaise sauce/Bernaise sauce This usually contains partially cooked egg yolk and so should be avoided as it carries a risk of salmonella poisoning. It is possible to make Béarnaise sauce with pasteurised egg instead, in which case it is safe.</p>
<p>Beer Once believed to be good for breastfeeding, but research has shown that this is a myth. For safety in pregnancy, see the information on alcohol on page 49.</p>
<p>Bitter lemon It is safe to drink bitter lemon while you are pregnant. Also see quinine.</p>
<p>Black pudding It is fine to eat black pudding while you are pregnant, providing it has been stored in the fridge and cooked properly all the way through. It is a good source of iron but also high in salt and saturated fat so it is not healthy to eat large amounts.</p>
<p>Bran The outer layer of cereal grains, such as wheat and rice, is called bran. It’s a concentrated form of dietary fibre. Sprinkling bran on your food may help to relieve constipation, but it will also reduce the absorption of some vitamins and minerals, including iron and zinc. It is much better to eat fibre-rich foods such as wholegrain cereals (e.g. wholemeal bread, brown rice), pulses (e.g. lentils, beans) and fruit and vegetables, as these contain higher levels of essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Breakfast cereal It’s good to start the day with breakfast cereal and it also makes a healthy snack. Try to eat a cereal that’s fortified with vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and iron, as these are particularly important at this time. Organic cereals are not fortified in the UK, and neither are some budget-value ranges of cereals, so check the label. It is also a good idea to choose a high-fibre breakfast cereal to help prevent constipation.</p>
<p>Brie Should be avoided because of the risk of listeria, which could harm your unborn baby. This includes Brie made with pasteurised or unpasteurised milk. However, dishes such as deep-fried Brie, where the cheese is piping hot, are safe, because any listeria is killed during cooking. See page 45 for more about listeria.</p>
<p>Caesar salad The dressing on Caesar salad usually contains raw egg, which carries a risk of salmonella, so it is best avoided while pregnant. See page 47 for more about salmonella. However, bottles of Caesar salad dressing sold in supermarkets will be made with pasteurised egg and are therefore considered safe.</p>
<p>Calabash chalk This is a type of chalk (also known as Calabar stone, La Craie, Argile, Nzu and Mabele) used to alleviate morning sickness. It is traditionally used by women from West Africa and is imported from Africa to the UK. However, it is not recommended, as it has been found to contain high levels of lead, which could harm your baby’s developing nervous system.</p>
<p>Camembert This is a soft cheese and should be avoided during pregnancy because of the risk of listeria. This includes Camembert made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk. However, dishes such as deep-fried Camembert, where the cheese is piping hot, are safe, because any listeria will be killed during cooking. See page 45 for more about listeria.</p>
<p>Carbonara sauce Spaghetti or other pasta with home made carbonara sauce should be avoided during pregnancy as it is usually made with raw eggs. If you buy carbonara sauce from a supermarket, either refrigerated or in a jar, it is fine to eat, as it will contain pasteurised eggs or be made without eggs. Most restaurants, including Bella Italia and Prezzo, also make their sauce with pasteurised egg but in more expensive or traditional Italian restaurants it may be best to check.</p>
<p>Chalk White chalk is calcium carbonate, which the body can use just like the calcium in food. If you experience a craving for chalk, or anything else that isn’t normally considered a food or drink, it is known as ‘pica’ (see page 17). Eating small amounts of white chalk is unlikely to do any harm. However, consuming large quantities could cause the calcium level in your blood to become too high, which might cause problems for you and your baby. It is not advisable to eat coloured chalk, as the colourings it contains may not be the same as those used for food and will not have been tested to see whether they can be safely consumed.</p>
<p>Cheddar cheese This is a hard cheese and is safe to eat, whether made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk.</p>
<p>Cheese Some cheeses should not be eaten during pregnancy as they could be contaminated with listeria. This applies to soft, mould-ripened cheeses (e.g. Brie) and soft blue-veined cheeses (e.g. Danish Blue), whether they are made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk. You should also avoid soft cheeses made from unpasteurised goats’ and sheep’s milk (e.g. Chèvre). However, thorough cooking kills listeria. Therefore, it should be safe to eat these cheeses if they are part of a hot dish (e.g. on a pizza or in a sauce) – you just need to make sure that they are properly cooked and piping hot all the way through.</p>
<p>Hard cheeses (e.g. Cheddar, Edam) are safer because they are more acidic and contain less moisture, so they’re less likely to allow bacteria to grow. These are considered safe whether they are made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk. The suitability of Stilton can vary (see page 166).</p>
<p>Feta cheese and soft cheeses that aren’t mould-ripened (e.g. mozzarella, ricotta, cottage cheese) are considered safe if they are made from pasteurised milk. You are unlikely to come across cheeses, such as cottage cheese, made from unpasteurised milk but if you do they should be avoided. It is best to buy soft cheeses pre-packaged and eat them before the use-by date, and avoid buying them from delicatessen counters, where cross-contamination from other foods may occur.</p>

<p>NB The rules for organic cheese are the same as those for non-organic cheese, both for cheeses that are safe and cheeses to avoid.</p>
<p>Cheesecake It is fine to eat cheesecake that has been cooked (sometimes described as a baked cheesecake). You can also safely eat cheesecake sold in supermarkets and similar shops, as they should be made with pasteurised egg, which removes any risk of salmonella. Cheesecakes are sometimes made with ricotta or mascarpone cheese, both of which are safe to eat during pregnancy.</p>
<p>You should avoid eating homemade cheesecakes that are not cooked. These contain gelatine and are put in the fridge to set. They carry the risk of salmonella as they contain uncooked eggs. If you are unsure about how a homemade cheesecake or one in a restaurant has been made, it is best to ask.</p>
<p>Cheese spread Processed cheese spreads, such as Dairylea, Laughing Cow, Primula and similar own-brand products from supermarkets, are fine to eat. Also see cream cheese.</p>
<p>Chicken Provides a good source of protein, iron and B vitamins. It is important to check that it is cooked thoroughly until the juices run clear before eating, otherwise it can cause salmonella food poisoning. See page 47 for more on salmonella.</p>
<p>Chillies See spicy food.</p>
<p>Chocolate A study in Finland found that mothers who ate chocolate regularly when they were pregnant had babies who smiled and laughed more. The results of another study, from the USA, suggest that chocolate may reduce the risks of pre-eclampsia, though there is not enough evidence at the moment to know whether this is true.</p>
<p>Despite these possible benefits, you should avoid eating too much chocolate, as it contains caffeine as well as sugar and fat, which can contribute to a high weight gain.</p>
<p>Chocolate mousse See mousse.</p>
<p>Chorizo See cured meats.</p>
<p>Cider vinegar/apple cider vinegar To treat morning sickness, some people recommend putting a few drops or a teaspoonful of cider vinegar into a glass of cold or warm water. This remedy seems to be more popular in the USA than the UK. Advocates believe that sipping this with meals or throughout the day will help reduce nausea. A teaspoon of honey can be added to make it taste better. It is also thought to be effective for heartburn or acid reflux. There is no scientific evidence that it is effective, but some women believe it helps and there is certainly no harm in trying.</p>
<p>Some enthusiasts believe only unpasteurised apple cider vinegar is effective. However, this is best avoided because of the risk of food poisoning.</p>
<p>Cinnamon It is fine to eat cinnamon while you are pregnant, including porridge or breakfast cereals flavoured with cinnamon and baked goods such as cinnamon swirls and other cakes and biscuits. Indeed, adding cinnamon to foods like porridge can be beneficial as it has a sweet flavour and therefore you don’t need to add as much sugar. However, cinnamon supplements should be avoided and it is probably best not to eat very large amounts – e.g. more than one teaspoon of cinnamon per day.</p>
<p>Two different types of cinnamon are widely used. The first is Ceylon cinnamon (real name Cinnamomum zeylanicum and also known as ‘True cinnamon’ or ‘Sri Lankan cinnamon’). The other type is cassia cinnamon (also known as Cinnamomum aromatium or Chinese cinnamon). Cassia cinnamon contains high levels of coumarin, which is associated with liver damage when eaten in large amounts. It is estimated that one teaspoon of cassia cinnamon would contain about 6–12mg of coumarin, which is more than the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) considers safe to consume in a single day. Therefore if you use a lot of cinnamon it is best to choose Ceylon cinnamon. If you buy cinnamon sticks in the UK these will almost certainly be Ceylon cinnamon. However, if you buy ground cinnamon powder it may be either Ceylon or cassia cinnamon. At the time of writing Bart’s and Tesco ‘ground cinnamon’ was Ceylon cinnamon but Schwartz ‘ground cinnamon’ was cassia cinnamon. Information about the type of cinnamon is sometimes provided in the small print on labels but otherwise you can contact the manufacturer.</p>
<p>There is some suggestion that cinnamon is good if you’re feeling especially hungry as it acts as a natural appetite suppressant. There are also claims that it helps stabilise blood glucose levels, reduce blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels and that is has anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. The evidence to support these health benefits is weak at best and research has produced mixed results.</p>
<p>Clay Sometimes known as sikor or shikor mati. Baked clay is thought by some to be beneficial during pregnancy, but in 2011 the FSA warned women not to eat it. They found it contained high levels of lead, which could affect a baby’s brain development, and arsenic, which increases the risk of lung, skin and bladder cancer.</p>
<p>Coffee It is safe to drink coffee during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, but you shouldn’t have more than about two mugs of instant coffee or two cups of real coffee a day (see page 50).</p>
<p>Cola It is safe to drink cola before or during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding, but you shouldn’t have too much. It contains about 40mg of caffeine per 330ml can, so you need to count it alongside tea and coffee (see page 50). Regular (not diet) varieties also contain about 140kcal per can, so if you drink large quantities you may gain excess weight without giving your baby the vitamins and minerals he or she needs. Diet, light and lite varieties contain the same amount of caffeine as regular colas, unless you specifically choose a caffeine-free product. They also contain artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Coleslaw It is fine to eat coleslaw that is freshly made with salad cream or mayonnaise from a jar. Once coleslaw has been prepared, it should be stored in the fridge. Readymade coleslaw sold in the UK is also considered safe by the FSA. In some other countries, including the USA and Australia, women are advised to avoid pre-prepared coleslaw, particularly when sold at deli counters, because of the risk of listeria.</p>
<p>Coleslaw prepared using homemade mayonnaise should be avoided as it contains raw eggs and could therefore result in salmonella poisoning.</p>
<p>Cookie dough ice cream It is fine to eat cookie dough flavoured ice cream, such as that made by Häagen-Dazs or Ben &amp; Jerry’s. Both the ice cream and the cookie dough pieces are made with pasteurised egg. However, as it is high in sugar, fat and saturated fat, it is best eaten in moderation.</p>
<p>Corned beef This is fine to eat while you are pregnant but make sure you follow the storage instructions on the packet or tin. In some countries pregnant women are advised to avoid pre-packed cold meats during pregnancy but this is not the case in the UK.</p>
<p>Cottage cheese It is fine to eat cottage cheese during pregnancy, provided it is made from pasteurised milk. However, avoid buying it from a delicatessen counter.</p>
<p>Crab It is OK to eat crab if it is cooked properly and eaten hot – for example, crab cakes or crab and sweetcorn soup.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t have more than two portions of crab per week as it could be contaminated with similar levels of pollutants as oily fish. It is best to avoid any crab that is served cold if you are unsure about how recently it has been cooked and how it has been stored. It could be contaminated with listeria or other food poisoning bacteria.</p>
<p>Crab sticks See seafood sticks.</p>
<p>Cranberry juice It is safe to drink cranberry juice while you are pregnant. It contains proanthocyanidins and fructose, which seem to prevent bacteria sticking to the wall of the bladder. This helps reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, these components aren’t able to unstick bacteria that are already attached so if you have a UTI already, drinking cranberry juice is not an appropriate cure. Instead it is best to see your GP as antibiotics may be needed to relieve the symptoms and prevent pregnancy complications (see page 97).</p>
<p>Crayfish See shellfish.</p>
<p>Cream It is safe to eat all types of cream, including soured cream, clotted cream and crème fraiche, provided it is made from pasteurised milk. Raw or unpasteurised cream is not widely available but is sold at some farmers’ markets and specialist farm shops. Cream, and products such as cream cakes that contain raw cream, are legally required to give a warning on the packaging.</p>
<p>Cream cheese This is safe to eat in pregnancy provided it is made from pasteurised milk. Products such as Philadelphia and similar own-brand soft cheese are therefore safe.</p>
<p>Crème anglaise See custard.</p>
<p>Crème brûlée It is generally safe to eat crème brûlée sold in supermarkets and other shops as it is made from pasteurised eggs.</p>
<p>Homemade crème brûlée contains partially cooked eggs and should be avoided. In a restaurant, it is best to ask how it has been made.</p>
<p>Crème caramel It is safe to eat the kind of crème caramel sold in individual tubs in supermarkets, as it is made from pasteurised egg.</p>
<p>Homemade crème caramel contains partially cooked eggs and should be avoided. In a restaurant, it is best to ask how it has been made.</p>
<p>Crème fraiche See cream.</p>
<p>Cured meats For example, Parma ham, salami, prosciutto crudo, chorizo, Serrano ham and pepperoni. These are not cooked but preserved by salting and smoking, or by treating with sodium nitrite and nitrate. This means there’s a risk they could contain parasites that cause toxoplasmosis (see page 46). To reduce the risk of toxoplasmosis the NHS suggests freezing cured or fermented meats for four days before eating. This will kill most parasites and make the meat safer to eat. However, if you are going to cook it (e.g. pepperoni pizza or pasta with chorizo) then there is no need to freeze the meat, as cooking will also kill the parasites.</p>
<p>Some ‘cured ham’ or ‘dry-cured ham’ is roasted or baked after curing, in which case it is safe to eat. However, if there is no mention of cooking on the label, then you should assume that it is not cooked.</p>
<p>Curry See spicy food.</p>
<p>Custard It is fine to eat custard from a tin, long-life UHT readymade custard sold in a carton, chilled custard sold in a supermarket described as ‘fresh custard’, and custard prepared by mixing custard powder with milk (providing it’s pasteurised milk). All these products are made with pasteurised egg. It is also fine to eat egg custard tarts and custard slices sold in supermarkets.</p>
<p>Homemade custard prepared using fresh eggs should not be eaten, as the eggs are only partially cooked and therefore could contain salmonella. In restaurants this is sometimes called crème anglaise – if you see it on a menu, it is best to ask whether it has been made with pasteurised eggs, and if not, avoid it.</p>
<p>Deli foods The advice in the USA, Australia and New Zealand is not to eat food from delicatessen shops or counters if you are pregnant. The UK has no specific guidelines. However, it would be sensible to choose pre-packaged food rather than deli products whenever possible. This is because unpackaged foods can become contaminated with listeria from other products. Low-risk foods such as ham may have been handled with the same utensils used on higher-risk foods such as salami. In addition, you have no way of knowing whether deli foods are beyond their use-by date.</p>
<p><strong>食物与食材 A-Z 指南</strong></p>
<p>在本章中，您可以查阅任何食物或食材，了解在孕期和哺乳期：</p>
<p>• ✅ 正常量食用安全</p>
<p>• ❌ 为安全起见应避免</p>
<p>• ⚠️ 适量食用或在特定条件下可以</p>
<p>有些项目没有标注符号，因为目前尚无定论。我们提供了所有证据，您可以自行决定是否食用。如果您吃了某种食物后才发现不应该吃，请不要过于担心：风险通常很小（见第xiv页）。</p>
<p><strong>A</strong></p>
<p><strong>添加剂 (Additives)</strong></p>
<p>英国食品标准局（FSA）认为英国使用的所有添加剂在孕期食用都是安全的。在评估任何添加剂的安全性时，FSA会考察化学物质的生殖毒性及其改变遗传物质的能力。虽然单个添加剂的安全性经过测试，但人们担忧同时摄入多种不同添加剂可能产生的&quot;鸡尾酒效应&quot;。另一个问题是，含有大量添加剂的食品通常过度加工，脂肪、盐和糖含量高，而必需维生素和矿物质含量低。理想情况下，应尽量减少含添加剂的食品，多吃水果、蔬菜、豆类和全谷物等未加工食品。另见人工甜味剂、亚硝酸盐和亚硫酸盐。</p>
<p><strong>杏仁 (Almonds)</strong></p>
<p>蛋白质、铜、烟酸、核黄素和维生素E的良好来源。除非您对杏仁过敏，否则无需避免。</p>
<p><strong>凤尾鱼 (Anchovies)</strong></p>
<p>这是一种油性鱼类，是omega-3脂肪酸的良好来源，与三文鱼或沙丁鱼相似。孕期可以食用熟凤尾鱼，但每周不应超过两份油性鱼。罐装凤尾鱼也是安全的，但往往含盐量很高，因此不建议大量摄入。从超市密封盒中购买的腌制凤尾鱼也应该没问题，但如果您在西班牙小吃吧、熟食店或对食品储存或卫生不太放心的地方，最好避免。披萨上的凤尾鱼同样如此，虽然是罐装的，但可能开封太久或未冷藏保存。</p>
<p><strong>人工甜味剂 (Artificial sweeteners)</strong></p>
<p>这些被广泛用作糖的低热量或零热量替代品。有些可能被认为是&quot;天然的&quot;，因为它们是从叶子或糖中提取的。这里列出的所有甜味剂都经过欧洲食品安全局（EFSA）评估，并被批准作为健康饮食的一部分在食品和饮料中安全使用。一些专家对人工甜味剂的安全性，特别是在孕期使用表示担忧，但没有真正的证据支持这些说法。欧盟安全评估还检查添加剂（包括甜味剂）是否具有致癌性或毒性，是否对孕妇或儿童构成风险。理想情况下，最好吃未加工的食品，喝水而不是无糖饮料，但如果您很难减少糖的摄入量，那么适量食用人工甜味的食品和饮料可能会有所帮助。</p>

<p><strong>B</strong></p>
<p><strong>香蕉 (Bananas)</strong></p>
<p>如果孕期或哺乳期能量下降，这是一种很好的健康零食。有些女性发现香蕉会导致胃灼热，但除此之外没有必要避免。</p>
<p><strong>烧烤食品 (Barbecued food)</strong></p>
<p>确保所有肉类、汉堡、香肠、鱼类等都正确烹饪，否则有食物中毒的风险。即使表面看起来熟了，也要检查中心是否滚烫。此外，尽量避免过度烧焦的食物：烹饪过程会产生多环芳烃（PAHs）和杂环胺（HAs），包括一些可能在孕期有害的致癌化学物质。最好将摄入量保持在最低限度，尽管尚未确定安全水平。在烧烤时，还要检查沙拉是否彻底清洗，并避免在外面放置太久的食物，因为食物中毒细菌在温暖天气中繁殖迅速。</p>
<p><strong>罗勒 (Basil)</strong></p>
<p>正常量食用是安全的。然而，当浓缩或大量使用时，它是几种具有子宫刺激作用的草药之一。因此，孕期应避免使用罗勒油（常用于芳香疗法）。</p>
<p><strong>豆芽 (Bean sprouts)</strong></p>
<p>孕期应避免食用生豆芽，因为有沙门氏菌风险。如果想吃，应彻底加热至滚烫。这包括标注为&quot;即食&quot;的豆芽。FSA在2010年发布此建议，此前发现100多例与生豆芽可能相关的沙门氏菌Bareilly病例。</p>
<p><strong>贝阿恩酱/伯那西酱 (Béarnaise sauce)</strong></p>
<p>通常含有半熟蛋黄，因此应避免，因为有沙门氏菌中毒风险。可以用巴氏杀菌蛋制作贝阿恩酱，这种情况下是安全的。</p>
<p><strong>啤酒 (Beer)</strong></p>
<p>曾被认为有益于母乳喂养，但研究表明这是一个误解。关于孕期安全，请参阅第49页的酒精信息。</p>
<p><strong>苦柠檬水 (Bitter lemon)</strong></p>
<p>孕期饮用苦柠檬水是安全的。另见奎宁。</p>
<p><strong>黑布丁/血肠 (Black pudding)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以食用黑布丁，前提是它已冷藏保存并彻底煮熟。它是铁的良好来源，但盐和饱和脂肪含量也很高，因此不宜大量食用。</p>
<p><strong>麸皮 (Bran)</strong></p>
<p>谷物（如小麦和大米）的外层称为麸皮。它是膳食纤维的浓缩形式。在食物上撒麸皮可能有助于缓解便秘，但也会减少某些维生素和矿物质的吸收，包括铁和锌。更好的选择是吃富含纤维的食物，如全谷物（如全麦面包、糙米）、豆类（如扁豆、豆类）以及水果和蔬菜，因为这些含有更高水平的必需营养素。</p>
<p><strong>早餐麦片 (Breakfast cereal)</strong></p>
<p>早餐吃麦片是很好的，它也是健康的零食。尝试吃添加了维生素和矿物质的麦片，包括叶酸和铁，因为这些在此时特别重要。有机麦片在英国不添加营养强化剂，一些廉价系列麦片也不添加，所以要查看标签。选择高纤维早餐麦片也是个好主意，有助于预防便秘。</p>
<p><strong>布里奶酪 (Brie)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 应避免，因为有李斯特菌风险，可能伤害未出生的婴儿。这包括用巴氏杀菌或未杀菌牛奶制成的布里奶酪。然而，像炸布里奶酪这样的菜肴，如果奶酪滚烫，是安全的，因为任何李斯特菌都会在烹饪过程中被杀死。有关李斯特菌的更多信息，请参阅第45页。</p>
<p><strong>C</strong></p>
<p><strong>凯撒沙拉 (Caesar salad)</strong></p>
<p>凯撒沙拉的酱汁通常含有生蛋，有沙门氏菌风险，因此孕期最好避免。有关沙门氏菌的更多信息，请参阅第47页。然而，超市出售的瓶装凯撒沙拉酱是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的，因此被认为是安全的。</p>
<p><strong>卡拉巴粉笔 (Calabash chalk)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这是一种粉笔（也称为卡拉巴石、La Craie、Argile、Nzu和Mabele），用于缓解孕吐。传统上由西非妇女使用，从非洲进口到英国。然而，不建议使用，因为发现它含有高水平的铅，可能伤害婴儿发育中的神经系统。</p>
<p><strong>卡门贝尔奶酪 (Camembert)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这是一种软奶酪，孕期应避免，因为有李斯特菌风险。这包括用巴氏杀菌或未杀菌牛奶制成的卡门贝尔。然而，像炸卡门贝尔这样的菜肴，如果奶酪滚烫，是安全的，因为任何李斯特菌都会在烹饪过程中被杀死。有关李斯特菌的更多信息，请参阅第45页。</p>
<p><strong>卡博纳拉酱 (Carbonara sauce)</strong></p>
<p>孕期应避免用自制卡博纳拉酱制作的意大利面或其他面食，因为它通常用生蛋制成。如果您从超市购买卡博纳拉酱，无论是冷藏的还是罐装的，都可以安全食用，因为它们含有巴氏杀菌蛋或不含蛋。大多数餐厅，包括Bella Italia和Prezzo，也用巴氏杀菌蛋制作酱汁，但在更高档或传统的意大利餐厅，最好确认一下。</p>
<p><strong>粉笔 (Chalk)</strong></p>
<p>白色粉笔是ite钙，身体可以像食物中的钙一样使用。如果您对粉笔或任何其他通常不被视为食物或饮料的东西有强烈渴望，这被称为&quot;异食癖&quot;（见第17页）。少量食用白色粉笔不太可能造成伤害。然而，大量食用可能导致血液中钙水平过高，可能对您和宝宝造成问题。不建议食用彩色粉笔，因为其中的色素可能与食品色素不同，且未经测试是否可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>切达奶酪 (Cheddar cheese)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 这是一种硬奶酪，无论是用巴氏杀菌还是未杀菌牛奶制成的，都可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>奶酪 (Cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期不应食用某些奶酪，因为它们可能被李斯特菌污染。这适用于软质霉菌成熟奶酪（如布里）和软质蓝纹奶酪（如丹麦蓝纹奶酪），无论它们是用巴氏杀菌还是未杀菌牛奶制成的。您还应该避免用未杀菌的山羊奶和绵羊奶制成的软奶酪（如Chèvre）。然而，彻底加热可以杀死李斯特菌。因此，如果这些奶酪是热菜的一部分（如在披萨上或在酱汁中），应该是安全的——您只需要确保它们被正确烹饪并且整个都滚烫。</p>
<p>硬奶酪（如切达、艾登）更安全，因为它们更酸性，含水量更少，所以不太可能让细菌生长。无论是用巴氏杀菌还是未杀菌牛奶制成的，都被认为是安全的。斯蒂尔顿的适宜性可能有所不同（见第166页）。</p>
<p>菲达奶酪和非霉菌成熟的软奶酪（如马苏里拉、瑞可塔、农家奶酪）如果是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成的，被认为是安全的。您不太可能遇到用未杀菌牛奶制成的农家奶酪等奶酪，但如果遇到应该避免。最好购买预包装的软奶酪，并在保质期前食用，避免从熟食柜台购买，因为那里可能发生与其他食品的交叉污染。</p>

<p><strong>芝士蛋糕 (Cheesecake)</strong></p>
<p>可以食用烘焙过的芝士蛋糕（有时描述为烤芝士蛋糕）。您也可以安全食用超市和类似商店出售的芝士蛋糕，因为它们应该是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的，这消除了沙门氏菌风险。芝士蛋糕有时用瑞可塔或马斯卡彭奶酪制成，这两种在孕期都可以安全食用。</p>
<p>您应该避免食用未烘焙的自制芝士蛋糕。这些含有明胶，放入冰箱凝固。它们有沙门氏菌风险，因为含有未煮熟的蛋。如果您不确定自制芝士蛋糕或餐厅的芝士蛋糕是如何制作的，最好询问。</p>
<p><strong>奶酪酱 (Cheese spread)</strong></p>
<p>加工奶酪酱，如Dairylea、笑牛、Primula以及超市类似自有品牌产品，可以安全食用。另见奶油奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>鸡肉 (Chicken)</strong></p>
<p>是蛋白质、铁和B族维生素的良好来源。食用前务必检查是否彻底煮熟，直到汁水透明，否则可能导致沙门氏菌食物中毒。有关沙门氏菌的更多信息，请参阅第47页。</p>
<p><strong>辣椒 (Chillies)</strong></p>
<p>见辛辣食物。</p>
<p><strong>巧克力 (Chocolate)</strong></p>
<p>芬兰的一项研究发现，孕期经常吃巧克力的母亲生的宝宝微笑和笑得更多。美国的另一项研究结果表明，巧克力可能降低先兆子痫的风险，尽管目前没有足够的证据来确定这是否属实。</p>
<p>尽管有这些可能的好处，您应该避免吃太多巧克力，因为它含有咖啡因以及糖和脂肪，可能导致体重增加过多。</p>
<p><strong>巧克力慕斯 (Chocolate mousse)</strong></p>
<p>见慕斯。</p>
<p><strong>西班牙辣香肠 (Chorizo)</strong></p>
<p>见腌制肉类。</p>
<p><strong>苹果醋 (Cider vinegar/apple cider vinegar)</strong></p>
<p>为了治疗孕吐，有些人建议在一杯冷水或温水中滴几滴或加一茶匙苹果醋。这种疗法在美国似乎比英国更受欢迎。支持者认为，在用餐时或全天小口喝这种饮料有助于减少恶心。可以加一茶匙蜂蜜使味道更好。它也被认为对胃灼热或胃酸反流有效。没有科学证据证明它有效，但一些女性相信它有帮助，尝试一下肯定没有坏处。</p>
<p>一些爱好者认为只有未经巴氏杀菌的苹果醋才有效。然而，由于食物中毒风险，最好避免。</p>
<p><strong>肉桂 (Cinnamon)</strong></p>
<p>孕期食用肉桂是可以的，包括肉桂味的粥或早餐麦片，以及肉桂卷和其他蛋糕和饼干等烘焙食品。事实上，在粥等食物中添加肉桂可能是有益的，因为它有甜味，因此您不需要添加那么多糖。然而，应避免服用肉桂补充剂，最好不要吃很大量——例如，每天超过一茶匙的肉桂。</p>
<p>两种不同类型的肉桂被广泛使用。第一种是锡兰肉桂（学名Cinnamomum zeylanicum，也称为&quot;真正的肉桂&quot;或&quot;斯里兰卡肉桂&quot;）。另一种是决明子肉桂（也称为Cinnamomum aromatium或中国肉桂）。决明子肉桂含有高水平的香豆素，大量食用与肝损伤有关。据估计，一茶匙决明子肉桂含有约6-12毫克香豆素，超过欧洲食品安全局（EFSA）认为一天内安全摄入的量。因此，如果您大量使用肉桂，最好选择锡兰肉桂。如果您在英国购买肉桂棒，几乎肯定是锡兰肉桂。然而，如果您购买肉桂粉，可能是锡兰肉桂或决明子肉桂。在撰写本文时，Bart&rsquo;s和Tesco的&quot;肉桂粉&quot;是锡兰肉桂，但Schwartz的&quot;肉桂粉&quot;是决明子肉桂。有关肉桂类型的信息有时会在标签的小字中提供，否则您可以联系制造商。</p>
<p>有一些说法认为，如果您感到特别饥饿，肉桂很好，因为它是天然的食欲抑制剂。还有声称它有助于稳定血糖水平、降低血压和血胆固醇水平，并具有抗菌和抗氧化特性。支持这些健康益处的证据充其量是薄弱的，研究产生了不同的结果。</p>
<p><strong>粘土 (Clay)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 有时被称为sikor或shikor mati。烤粘土被一些人认为在孕期有益，但在2011年，FSA警告妇女不要食用。他们发现它含有高水平的铅（可能影响婴儿的大脑发育）和砷（增加肺癌、皮肤癌和膀胱癌的风险）。</p>
<p><strong>咖啡 (Coffee)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期和哺乳期饮用咖啡是安全的，但每天不应超过约两杯速溶咖啡或两杯现磨咖啡（见第50页）。</p>
<p><strong>可乐 (Cola)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕前、孕期和哺乳期饮用可乐是安全的，但不应过量。每330毫升罐含有约40毫克咖啡因，因此需要与茶和咖啡一起计算（见第50页）。普通（非无糖）品种每罐还含有约140千卡热量，因此如果大量饮用，可能会在没有给宝宝提供所需维生素和矿物质的情况下体重增加过多。无糖、低脂和淡味品种含有与普通可乐相同的咖啡因，除非您特别选择无咖啡因产品。它们还含有人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>卷心菜沙拉 (Coleslaw)</strong></p>
<p>用罐装沙拉酱或蛋黄酱新鲜制作的卷心菜沙拉可以安全食用。卷心菜沙拉制作后应存放在冰箱中。FSA认为英国出售的现成卷心菜沙拉也是安全的。在其他一些国家，包括美国和澳大利亚，建议妇女避免预制的卷心菜沙拉，特别是在熟食柜台出售的，因为有李斯特菌风险。</p>
<p>用自制蛋黄酱制作的卷心菜沙拉应该避免，因为它含有生蛋，可能导致沙门氏菌中毒。</p>
<p><strong>曲奇面团冰淇淋 (Cookie dough ice cream)</strong></p>
<p>可以食用曲奇面团口味的冰淇淋，如Häagen-Dazs或Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s制作的。冰淇淋和曲奇面团块都是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。然而，由于糖、脂肪和饱和脂肪含量高，最好适量食用。</p>
<p><strong>咸牛肉 (Corned beef)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用，但要确保遵循包装或罐头上的储存说明。在一些国家，建议孕妇在孕期避免预包装冷切肉，但英国没有这种情况。</p>
<p><strong>农家奶酪 (Cottage cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用农家奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。然而，避免从熟食柜台购买。</p>
<p><strong>蟹 (Crab)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果蟹被正确烹饪并趁热食用是可以的——例如，蟹饼或蟹肉玉米汤。</p>
<p>每周不应超过两份蟹，因为它可能含有与油性鱼类相似水平的污染物。如果不确定最近的烹饪时间和储存方式，最好避免冷食的蟹。它可能被李斯特菌或其他食物中毒细菌污染。</p>
<p><strong>蟹棒 (Crab sticks)</strong></p>
<p>见海鲜棒。</p>
<p><strong>蔓越莓汁 (Cranberry juice)</strong></p>
<p>孕期饮用蔓越莓汁是安全的。它含有原花青素和果糖，似乎可以防止细菌附着在膀胱壁上。这有助于降低尿路感染（UTI）的风险。然而，这些成分无法使已经附着的细菌脱落，所以如果您已经有UTI，喝蔓越莓汁不是适当的治疗方法。相反，最好去看医生，因为可能需要抗生素来缓解症状和预防孕期并发症（见第97页）。</p>
<p><strong>小龙虾 (Crayfish)</strong></p>
<p>见贝类。</p>
<p><strong>奶油 (Cream)</strong></p>
<p>所有类型的奶油都可以安全食用，包括酸奶油、凝脂奶油和法式酸奶油，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。生奶油或未经巴氏杀菌的奶油不广泛销售，但在一些农贸市场和专业农场商店有售。奶油和含有生奶油的产品（如奶油蛋糕）在法律上要求在包装上给出警告。</p>
<p><strong>奶油奶酪 (Cream cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。因此，费城奶酪和类似的自有品牌软奶酪等产品是安全的。</p>
<p><strong>英式蛋奶酱 (Crème anglaise)</strong></p>
<p>见蛋奶羹。</p>
<p><strong>焦糖布丁 (Crème brûlée)</strong></p>
<p>超市和其他商店出售的焦糖布丁通常可以安全食用，因为它是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。</p>
<p>自制焦糖布丁含有半熟蛋，应该避免。在餐厅，最好询问是如何制作的。</p>
<p><strong>焦糖奶油 (Crème caramel)</strong></p>
<p>超市以单独小盒出售的焦糖奶油可以安全食用，因为它是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。</p>
<p>自制焦糖奶油含有半熟蛋，应该避免。在餐厅，最好询问是如何制作的。</p>
<p><strong>法式酸奶油 (Crème fraiche)</strong></p>
<p>见奶油。</p>
<p><strong>腌制肉类 (Cured meats)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 例如，帕尔马火腿、萨拉米、意大利熏火腿、西班牙辣香肠、塞拉诺火腿和意大利辣肉肠。这些肉不是煮熟的，而是通过盐渍和烟熏，或用亚硝酸钠和硝酸盐处理保存的。这意味着有可能含有导致弓形虫病的寄生虫（见第46页）。为了降低弓形虫病风险，NHS建议在食用前将腌制或发酵肉类冷冻四天。这将杀死大多数寄生虫，使肉更安全食用。然而，如果您要烹饪它（如辣肉肠披萨或西班牙辣香肠意面），则无需冷冻肉，因为烹饪也会杀死寄生虫。</p>
<p>一些&quot;腌制火腿&quot;或&quot;干腌火腿&quot;在腌制后会烤制或烘烤，在这种情况下是安全食用的。然而，如果标签上没有提到烹饪，那么您应该假设它没有煮熟。</p>
<p><strong>咖喱 (Curry)</strong></p>
<p>见辛辣食物。</p>
<p><strong>蛋奶羹 (Custard)</strong></p>
<p>可以安全食用罐装蛋奶羹、纸盒装的长效UHT现成蛋奶羹、超市出售的标注为&quot;新鲜蛋奶羹&quot;的冷藏蛋奶羹，以及用蛋奶羹粉与牛奶混合制作的蛋奶羹（前提是使用巴氏杀菌牛奶）。所有这些产品都是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。超市出售的蛋奶塔和蛋奶酱切片也可以安全食用。</p>
<p>用新鲜鸡蛋制作的自制蛋奶羹不应食用，因为鸡蛋只是部分煮熟，因此可能含有沙门氏菌。在餐厅，这有时被称为crème anglaise——如果您在菜单上看到它，最好询问是否用巴氏杀菌蛋制作，如果不是，请避免。</p>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p><strong>熟食店食品 (Deli foods)</strong></p>
<p>美国、澳大利亚和新西兰的建议是，如果您怀孕了，不要吃熟食店或柜台的食物。英国没有具体的指南。然而，尽可能选择预包装食品而不是熟食产品是明智的。这是因为未包装的食品可能被其他产品的李斯特菌污染。低风险食品如火腿可能与处理高风险食品（如萨拉米）使用的相同器具接触过。此外，您无法知道熟食食品是否超过了保质期。</p>
<p><strong>无糖饮料 (Diet drinks)</strong></p>
<p>孕期或哺乳期被认为是安全的。然而，没有人知道高摄入人工甜味剂是否会产生长期影响，因此适量是明智的。另见人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>蘸酱 (Dips)</strong></p>
<p>预包装的蘸酱如鹰嘴豆泥、黄瓜酸奶酱、萨尔萨酱和酸奶油或酸奶基产品在孕期应该是安全食用的。</p>
<p>在熟食柜台出售的蘸酱最好避免，因为有交叉污染风险和对保质期的不确定性。任何含有蓝纹奶酪的蘸酱应该避免。</p>
<p><strong>鸭蛋 (Duck eggs)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以安全食用鸭蛋，前提是蛋黄和蛋白都煮至凝固。任何含有鸭蛋的菜肴都应该煮至整个都滚烫。2010年，FSA发布官方警告，提醒人们在烹饪和处理鸭蛋时要注意卫生。这是由于与鸭蛋相关的鸭型沙门氏菌DT8爆发，涉及63例病例，包括一例死亡。</p>
<p><strong>E</strong></p>
<p><strong>艾登奶酪 (Edam)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用艾登奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>蛋酒 (Eggnog)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 除了酒精，新鲜蛋酒还含有未煮熟的蛋，可能含有沙门氏菌。最好避免。</p>
<p><strong>鸡蛋 (Eggs)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ FSA目前建议孕妇避免生的或半熟的鸡蛋，因为它们可能含有沙门氏菌。然而，2016年2月，FSA开始了一个咨询程序，可能会改变这一建议。新指南可能建议带有英国狮子质量标志的鸡蛋可以生吃，但其他生的或半熟的鸡蛋应该避免。根据英国狮子质量规范，母鸡接种了沙门氏菌疫苗。测试表明，它们的蛋极不可能感染沙门氏菌。关于没有英国狮子质量标志的鸡蛋和在家外吃的鸡蛋的建议将保持不变——除非经过巴氏杀菌或煮至凝固，否则应该避免。这意味着用英国狮子质量鸡蛋自制冰淇淋将被认为是安全的，但在餐厅吃自制冰淇淋则不是。</p>
<p>可能含有生的或仅部分煮熟的鸡蛋的食品包括：</p>
<p>• 自制蛋黄酱</p>
<p>• 贝阿恩酱和荷兰酱</p>
<p>• 凯撒沙拉酱和类似的沙拉酱</p>
<p>• 自制甜点如冰淇淋、慕斯、芝士蛋糕、提拉米苏和柠檬蛋白派</p>
<p>• 自制皇家糖霜，如圣诞蛋糕或婚礼蛋糕上的</p>
<p>• 自制蛋奶羹</p>
<p>有机鸡蛋与散养、谷仓新鲜或任何其他类型的鸡蛋一样可能含有沙门氏菌。</p>
<p>煮至蛋白和蛋黄都凝固的鸡蛋是安全食用的。这将破坏可能存在的任何沙门氏菌。所以，如果彻底煮熟，您可以吃煮蛋、煎蛋或炒蛋。</p>
<p>重要的是将生蛋与其他食物分开存放，处理生蛋后要洗手和洗任何器具，以避免交叉污染。巴氏杀菌会杀死沙门氏菌，因此通常可以安全食用含有鸡蛋的商业生产食品，因为它几乎总是经过巴氏杀菌的。这包括蛋黄酱、冰淇淋和慕斯等食品。</p>
<p>在餐厅，注意可能含有未完全煮熟的鸡蛋的酱汁和甜点。如果您外出就餐且不确定，最好询问。</p>
<p>另见omega-3鸡蛋。</p>
<p><strong>班尼迪克蛋 (Eggs Benedict)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这道菜含有水煮蛋（蛋黄是流动的）和荷兰酱（用仅部分煮熟的鸡蛋制成）。应该避免，因为可能含有沙门氏菌。</p>
<p><strong>能量饮料 (Energy drinks)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果您感到疲倦需要提神，能量饮料可能看起来是答案。然而，大多数都添加了咖啡因或瓜拉那（也含有咖啡因）。就像咖啡或可乐一样，这些饮料计入您孕期每日200毫克的咖啡因限量（见第50页）。一些能量饮料还含有可能影响您或宝宝的草药。如果您不确定，最好避免。另见乐加力。</p>
<p><strong>蜗牛 (Escargot)</strong></p>
<p>经过安全采购、加工和烹饪的蜗牛在孕期应该是安全食用的。然而，最好不要吃您自己采集的蜗牛，因为它们不受相同的卫生法规约束，可能被有害细菌或化学物质污染。</p>
<p><strong>F</strong></p>
<p><strong>茴香茶 (Fennel tea)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 不建议孕期饮用，因为它被认为具有轻度激素作用并且是子宫刺激剂。没有关于摄入量的官方建议，但有些人建议孕期完全避免茴香茶，而另一些人建议每天最多两杯应该没问题。</p>
<p>一些哺乳期的母亲喝茴香茶（有时与其他成分混合）来增加奶量。没有科学证据证明它有效，但一些女性相信它有效。它不会造成伤害，所以如果您认为奶量不足，可能值得尝试茴香茶，同时确保您喝足够的液体、休息并遵循母乳喂养的一般建议（见第175页）。有关其他增加母乳量的茶，请参阅草药茶。</p>
<p><strong>菲达奶酪 (Feta cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用菲达奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。</p>
<p><strong>鱼 (Fish)</strong></p>
<p>建议孕妇、哺乳期妇女或计划怀孕的妇女每周至少吃两份鱼，包括一份油性鱼。一份约为140克煮熟的鱼，相当于烹饪前约170克。吃鱼时，确保正确烹饪以避免食物中毒风险。</p>
<p>如果您怀孕或计划怀孕，应避免食用鲨鱼、剑鱼或马林鱼。它们被发现含有微量的汞，可能影响未出生婴儿发育中的神经系统。如果您正在哺乳，每周不应超过一份这些鱼。金枪鱼也被发现含有汞，但量要低得多。见金枪鱼。</p>
<p>油性鱼如凤尾鱼、无须鳕、鲱鱼、熏鱼、鲭鱼、沙丁鱼、银鱼、三文鱼、沙丁鱼、鳟鱼和白饵对宝宝的大脑和眼睛发育很好。然而，油性鱼可能含有微量污染物，因此每周不应超过两份。见油性鱼（第150页）和omega-3（第60页）。</p>
<p>其他一些鱼类可能含有与油性鱼类似水平的污染物。每周不应超过两份角鲨（岩鱼）、鲈鱼、鲷鱼、大菱鲆、大比目鱼和蟹。</p>
<p>您可以在孕期吃的其他白鱼没有限量——如鳕鱼、黑鳕、黑线鳕、无须鳕、比目鱼、红娘鱼、鮟鱇鱼、鲻鱼（红色或灰色）、鲽鱼、狭鳕、红鲷鱼、鳐鱼、舌鳎、罗非鱼。白鱼脂肪含量低，提供蛋白质、碘、烟酸和硒。</p>
<p>另见寿司和烟熏鱼。</p>
<p><strong>碳酸饮料 (Fizzy drinks)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期偶尔喝碳酸饮料是安全的，尽管它们不是健康的选择，特别是如果您喝含糖的并且有妊娠糖尿病。一些还含有人工甜味剂，可乐和能量饮料都含有咖啡因。</p>
<p><strong>亚麻籽 (Flaxseeds)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 也称为亚麻仁，是α-亚麻酸（ALA）的良好来源，这是一种短链omega-3脂肪酸（见第58页）。然而，关于整粒亚麻籽有一些问题，选择亚麻籽油而不是整粒种子可能更好。</p>
<p>首先，亚麻籽有坚硬的外壳，因此需要研磨，或者至少压碎，才能从里面获得富含ALA的油。但也许更重要的是，亚麻籽还含有木脂素，具有类似激素的作用。因此，它们可以用于帮助治疗更年期潮热。但在孕期大量摄入亚麻籽可能不是一个好主意。对孕妇及其婴儿的实际影响尚不清楚，但对动物的研究发现，孕期大量摄入亚麻籽会减少窝产仔数和出生体重。素食协会和其他组织警告孕妇避免大量摄入亚麻籽，因为可能对激素平衡产生影响。</p>
<p>木脂素仅存在于亚麻籽的外壳中，因此只有当您吃整粒或压碎的亚麻籽时才会获得它们，而不是购买亚麻籽油时（但要小心，因为一些健康食品公司出售&quot;高木脂素亚麻籽油&quot;，其中添加了木脂素）。如果您想在饮食中加入亚麻籽油，最好冷食，例如在沙拉酱中，或在烹饪结束时添加，否则有益的ALA可能会分解。</p>
<p><strong>法式鲜奶酪 (Fromage frais)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用法式鲜奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。</p>
<p><strong>水果 (Fruit)</strong></p>
<p>水果是任何健康饮食的重要组成部分，如果您怀孕、哺乳或考虑要孩子，这尤其如此。水果富含重要的维生素、矿物质和植物化学物质。您每天应该至少吃五份水果和蔬菜。</p>
<p>一些女性发现酸性水果，如橙子，会引起胃灼热，尤其是在孕晚期。如果这对您是个问题，那么在一天较晚的时候或完全避免酸性水果一段时间。如果您在外面吃饭并且对卫生水平有顾虑，避免水果沙拉和其他预先准备的水果可能是个好主意。</p>
<p><strong>果汁 (Fruit juice)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 纯果汁算作您每天推荐的五份水果和蔬菜中的一份——但无论您喝多少，它永远不能算作超过一份。这是因为它不像整个水果那样含有那么多纤维，而且它含有游离糖，会损害牙齿并导致血糖水平急剧上升。一般建议每天不要喝超过150毫升的果汁或果昔。购买100%纯果汁总是比&quot;果汁饮料&quot;更健康，因为后者只含有少量果汁以及糖、人工甜味剂和其他添加剂。</p>
<p>一些女性发现，如果她们在哺乳期间大量喝橙汁，她们的宝宝会腹泻。如果发生这种情况，您应该减少果汁的摄入量。</p>
<p>孕期您应该只喝巴氏杀菌果汁或您自己在家榨的果汁。未经巴氏杀菌的果汁可能是李斯特菌或大肠杆菌的来源。超市购买的大多数果汁都经过巴氏杀菌，即使是那些冷藏出售并描述为&quot;鲜榨&quot;的。然而，从街头摊位、农贸市场和农场商店购买的鲜榨果汁可能未经巴氏杀菌。</p>
<p><strong>G</strong></p>
<p><strong>野味 (Game)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 孕期应避免食用用铅弹射杀的野味，因为它可能含有不健康水平的铅，可能伤害婴儿发育中的大脑和神经系统。这包括松鸡、鸭子、鹧鸪和野鸡（如果它们是铅弹射杀的）。与较小的野禽相比，鹿肉（鹿肉）通常肉中的铅浓度较低。超市出售的鹿肉被认为是安全的，因为它应该以安全的方式被杀死。如有疑问，最好询问。每周食用超过100克铅弹野味被认为特别危险。如果野禽在酸性液体（如葡萄酒、醋或番茄汁）中烹饪，它们会变得更成问题，因为铅可以被溶解，使人体肠道更容易吸收。</p>
<p><strong>大蒜 (Garlic)</strong></p>
<p>孕期吃大蒜或服用大蒜补充剂被一些人认为有助于预防高血压和先兆子痫。然而，没有进行足够的研究来确定它是否有效。它不太可能造成伤害，报告的唯一副作用是&quot;气味&quot;。</p>
<p>哺乳期吃大蒜已被证明会影响母乳的味道。这不是问题，除非您的宝宝似乎不喜欢这种味道或有不良反应（如胃部不适），否则没有必要避免大蒜（见第180页）。</p>
<p><strong>生姜 (Ginger)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 生姜是孕期孕吐和恶心的传统疗法。它的有效性已经在多项研究中进行了测试，结果表明，与安慰剂相比，它显著减少了恶心感。它在阻止女性呕吐方面似乎不太有效，但肯定对一些人有帮助。在两项试验中，生姜被发现比维生素B6胶囊更有效，在第三项试验中被发现同样有效。试验通常使用相当于每天1克（1,000毫克）生姜根的糖浆或胶囊，通常分为两次500毫克剂量、三次350毫克剂量或四次250毫克剂量。研究人员寻找了可能的风险，如流产增加，但没有发现。生姜似乎也不会增加胃灼热或嗜睡等问题的风险。如果您想服用生姜胶囊或糖果，请谨慎选择，因为有些含有非常浓缩形式的生姜，孕期的效果尚未测试。最好不要摄入超过相当于每天1,500毫克（1.5克）生姜根的量。</p>
<p>有几种吃生姜的方法：在炒菜、汤和酱汁中磨碎、在饼干和蛋糕中、结晶生姜、生姜果酱、姜啤酒和姜汁汽水（无酒精）。您也可以通过将少许生姜磨碎放入杯中并加入沸水来制作生姜茶。有些人发现加入柠檬和蜂蜜使其更可口。</p>
<p><strong>山羊奶酪 (Goats&rsquo; cheese)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 有几种不同类型的山羊奶酪可供选择。当我们想到山羊奶酪时，我们通常指的是Chèvre。这是一种有白色外皮的软奶酪，类似于布里奶酪。像其他霉菌成熟的奶酪一样，因为有李斯特菌风险，孕期应该避免。然而，如果它被彻底烹饪并趁热食用，任何李斯特菌都会被破坏。</p>
<p>可以安全食用用山羊奶制成的硬质切达型奶酪。如果软山羊奶酪是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成的并且没有外皮（这意味着它不是霉菌成熟的），也可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>腌三文鱼 (Gravlax)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 也称为gravad lax（瑞典语）和gravlaks（挪威语）。这是经过腌制或腌渍的生三文鱼，通常用盐和莳萝。它看起来与烟熏三文鱼相似，但实际上没有烟熏。在斯堪的纳维亚国家，烟熏三文鱼更常被食用，建议孕妇烟熏三文鱼可以安全食用，但腌制鱼（如腌三文鱼）不应该吃。英国没有关于孕期食用腌三文鱼安全性的官方建议。</p>
<p><strong>绿茶 (Green tea)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 没有足够的信息来确定孕期饮用绿茶是否安全，因此NHS建议孕妇每天饮用不超过四杯。绿茶含有咖啡因，就像普通红茶一样，因此在估计您的每日咖啡因摄入量时应包括它，并确保不超过每天200毫克的限量。咖啡因的量取决于您泡的浓度。一杯绿茶最多含有75毫克。它通常被认为是健康的选择，因为它富含抗氧化剂，可以预防心脏病和某些癌症，尽管没有证据表明绿茶实际上可以预防癌症。</p>
<p>有一些说法认为，在受孕前后大量饮用绿茶可能增加神经管缺陷的风险。这是因为其中发现的抗癌化合物表没食子儿茶素没食子酸酯（EPCG）会降低叶酸水平。虽然这方面的证据不强，但在尝试怀孕时，您可能希望将摄入量限制在每天只有两杯。</p>
<p>加拿大的研究人员发现，喝绿茶的孕妇血液中的铅和镉水平高于不喝绿茶的孕妇。这些金属被认为是环境污染物，与胎儿生长发育不良和大脑发育有关。水平在人群正常范围内，但它们高于不喝绿茶的女性这一事实表明需要谨慎。</p>
<p><strong>格鲁耶尔奶酪 (Gruyère cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用格鲁耶尔奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>瓜拉那 (Guarana)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这是一种最初在亚马逊发现的种子提取物。它含有咖啡因和相关化合物，被添加到一些能量饮料、草药饮料和口香糖中。不建议在孕期或哺乳期服用，因为它是兴奋剂，对您的宝宝的影响未知。</p>
<p><strong>健力士黑啤 (Guinness)</strong></p>
<p>与其他黑啤酒一样，健力士曾被认为对孕期有益，因为它含有大量铁，会&quot;增强体力&quot;。然而，健力士每100毫升只含有约0.01毫克铁，或每半品脱0.3毫克，而典型的一碗早餐麦片含有3.0-7.0毫克。当然，它还含有酒精，因此对孕期或哺乳期都不好。</p>
<p><strong>H</strong></p>
<p><strong>羊杂碎 (Haggis)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 羊杂碎的成分之一是肝脏，因此由于其高维生素A含量应该避免。见肝脏。</p>
<p>素食羊杂碎在孕期可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>哈罗米奶酪 (Halloumi cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用哈罗米奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。</p>
<p><strong>火腿 (Ham)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期可以安全食用预包装熟火腿。这通常被描述为烤制、水煮或蜂蜜烤火腿。</p>
<p>帕尔马火腿和其他腌制肉类应该避免，因为有弓形虫病风险。也明智地避免从熟食柜台购买的火腿，因为与其他高风险食品交叉污染导致的李斯特菌风险增加。</p>
<p><strong>草药茶 (Herbal teas)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 这些包括由根、浆果、花、种子或茶叶以外的叶子制成的任何茶。女性在孕期和哺乳期可能选择饮用它们来减少咖啡因摄入量，但NHS建议孕妇每天饮用不超过四杯草药茶或绿茶。一些草药茶，包括薄荷茶和生姜茶，被推荐用于与孕期相关的症状，如恶心。其他被认为可以增加奶量，例如茴香、胡芦巴、茴芹、覆盆子叶和荨麻。如果您购买草药茶，确保它来自信誉良好的来源。它应该包含所有成分的完整列表，并标有制造商和分销商的详细信息以及最佳使用日期。</p>
<p>含有您通常可能食用的成分的果茶（如黑醋栗、柠檬、橙子）被认为是安全的，但避免饮用由不熟悉的成分（如黑升麻、人参和薄荷）制成的任何茶是明智的。这些应该被视为药物或药品而不是食品，因为许多含有活性成分，以与药物相同的方式通过胎盘传递给宝宝或进入母乳。最好就其安全性寻求专业建议。</p>
<p>如果您怀孕了，在怀孕约32周之前不应饮用覆盆子叶茶。</p>
<p>如果您正在哺乳，应避免鼠尾草茶。</p>
<p>另见绿茶、覆盆子叶茶和鼠尾草。</p>
<p><strong>荷兰酱 (Hollandaise sauce)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这通常含有半熟蛋黄，因此孕期应避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险。然而，如果您从超市购买速成混合包或罐装荷兰酱，孕期可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>蜂蜜 (Honey)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期和哺乳期可以安全食用蜂蜜。蜂蜜偶尔会含有肉毒杆菌孢子，婴儿的肠道可能无法处理，导致婴儿肉毒杆菌中毒。因此，12个月以下的婴儿不应吃蜂蜜。然而，成人（包括孕妇）的肠道能够阻止任何肉毒杆菌的生长和引起任何问题。</p>
<p><strong>好立克 (Horlicks)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全饮用。见麦芽热饮。</p>
<p><strong>鹰嘴豆泥 (Houmous)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用鹰嘴豆泥。</p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p><strong>冰淇淋 (Ice cream)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 可以安全食用超市或类似商店预包装出售的盒装或单个冰淇淋。</p>
<p>自制冰淇淋通常含有生的或半熟的鸡蛋（就像蛋奶羹一样）。因此孕期应该避免，因为它可能含有沙门氏菌（见鸡蛋）。如果您自己制作冰淇淋，要么遵循不包含鸡蛋的配方，要么使用巴氏杀菌蛋。</p>
<p>您只应该在对卫生水平有信心的情况下从售货亭或冰淇淋车购买软冰淇淋（如Mr Whippy类型），因为如果软冰淇淋机没有保持一尘不染，就有李斯特菌风险。</p>
<p><strong>糖霜 (Icing)</strong></p>
<p>大多数类型的糖霜在孕期都可以安全食用。从超市和面包店购买的食品上的糖霜应该没问题。这包括软黄油糖霜、用奶油奶酪制成的糖霜（如胡萝卜蛋糕上的）和皇家糖霜。</p>
<p>然而，自制皇家糖霜是用生蛋白制成的，因此应该避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险。皇家糖霜经常出现在圣诞蛋糕和婚礼蛋糕上。如果它已经被制作并妥善保存，风险很小，但如果您有任何担心，最好避免。</p>
<p><strong>J</strong></p>
<p><strong>雅尔斯堡奶酪 (Jarlsberg)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用雅尔斯堡奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>果汁 (Juice)</strong></p>
<p>见果汁。</p>
<p><strong>K</strong></p>
<p><strong>海带 (Kelp)</strong></p>
<p>见海藻。</p>
<p><strong>L</strong></p>
<p><strong>柠檬凝乳 (Lemon curd)</strong></p>
<p>从超市购买的商业制备柠檬凝乳在孕期可以安全食用。</p>
<p>自制柠檬凝乳含有半熟蛋，孕期应避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险。</p>
<p><strong>柠檬汁 (Lemon juice)</strong></p>
<p>一些女性报告说，一汤匙柠檬汁是胃灼热的有效自然疗法。没有科学证据支持这一点，但它是完全安全的，值得一试。</p>
<p><strong>生菜 (Lettuce)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用生菜，前提是您彻底清洗它。您甚至应该清洗袋装购买的预洗沙拉叶，以避免李斯特菌和沙门氏菌风险。</p>
<p><strong>甘草 (Liquorice)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 根据NHS，孕期可以安全食用甘草。然而，适量食用是明智的，因为每周食用超过约250克与早产风险增加有关（37周前出生）。这是在芬兰发现的，那里甘草在年轻女性中非常受欢迎。不清楚为什么甘草有这种效果，但这可能与其甘草甜素含量有关。</p>
<p><strong>肝脏 (Liver)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 孕期应避免肝脏和用肝脏制成的食品，如肝酱、肝肠和羊杂碎。它们含有高水平的视黄醇形式的维生素A，可能伤害宝宝的发育（见第62页）。前几代女性被鼓励在孕期吃肝脏，因为它的高铁含量，这在当时可能是好建议。然而，现在动物食用高维生素A含量的饲料，导致它们肝脏中维生素水平升高，因此这个建议不再适用。</p>
<p>哺乳期可以安全食用肝脏。</p>
<p><strong>肝肠 (Liver sausage)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 孕期应避免，因为它的视黄醇形式维生素A含量非常高。见肝脏。</p>
<p><strong>乐加力 (Lucozade)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期饮用乐加力被认为是安全的，但一些品种含有咖啡因，一些糖含量极高。</p>
<p>一瓶500毫升的&quot;乐加力能量&quot;含有62克糖，一瓶500毫升的&quot;减糖乐加力能量&quot;含有40克糖，超过了每日推荐最大量30克。乐加力运动的糖含量低于乐加力能量，但每500毫升瓶仍含有18克。乐加力能量每500毫升瓶还含有60毫克咖啡因，这应该计入您每日200毫克的限量。</p>
<p><strong>M</strong></p>
<p><strong>鲭鱼 (Mackerel)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 这是一种油性鱼，是长链omega-3脂肪酸的良好来源。然而，每周不应超过两份（每份140克）。另见鱼和烟熏鲭鱼。</p>
<p><strong>麦芽热饮 (Malted hot drinks)</strong></p>
<p>好立克和阿华田在孕期都可以安全饮用。它们添加了维生素和矿物质，包括维生素A，但维生素A的量符合孕期建议。一杯好立克或阿华田含有不到300μg维生素A，这比两个鸡蛋中的含量多一点，只是您吃100克肝脏所获得量的2%。</p>
<p><strong>杏仁糖膏 (Marzipan)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 自制杏仁糖膏通常含有生蛋，因此孕期应避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险。然而，如果在蛋糕上糖霜之前让杏仁糖膏干燥一到三天，细菌生长的风险非常小。</p>
<p>使用熟杏仁糖膏更安全，因为它不包含鸡蛋。同样，超市购买的杏仁糖膏通常不含任何鸡蛋。这包括蛋糕上的杏仁糖膏和块状出售的杏仁糖膏。</p>
<p><strong>马斯卡彭奶酪 (Mascarpone cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用马斯卡彭奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。</p>
<p><strong>蛋黄酱 (Mayonnaise)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以安全食用从超市或类似商店购买的罐装蛋黄酱。在室温下出售（而不是冷藏）的蛋黄酱是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。</p>
<p>孕期应避免自制蛋黄酱，因为它含有生的未经巴氏杀菌的蛋，可能含有沙门氏菌（见鸡蛋）。偶尔，含有未经巴氏杀菌鸡蛋的新鲜蛋黄酱在商店和市场上出售。您通常可以识别出来，因为它是冷藏出售的，保质期相对较短。</p>
<p><strong>肉类 (Meat)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 大多数肉类和家禽是可以的，只要它们被正确烹饪，没有粉红色。应避免煮成三分熟的肉排和牛排。同样，如果您吃预制餐，确保它被正确加热，整个都滚烫。</p>
<p>您不应该吃生的或未煮熟的肉，因为它可能含有沙门氏菌、弯曲杆菌、弓形虫病或大肠杆菌。这意味着帕尔马火腿和萨拉米等腌制肉类是不可以的，除非它们事先被冷冻（见第130页）。</p>
<p>为避免生熟肉之间的交叉污染，分开存放并盖好，使用不同的刀、砧板和其他器具，处理生肉后仔细洗手。</p>
<p><strong>蛋白霜 (Meringue)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 超市和类似商店出售的蛋白霜在孕期应该是安全食用的，因为它们通常是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。如果煮熟正确且中间不再粘稠，自制的硬蛋白霜（例如帕芙洛娃或蛋白霜壳）也是安全食用的。核心温度应达到70°C两分钟，以确保可能存在的任何沙门氏菌都被杀死。如果按照正常烹饪说明在约110°C下烹饪两到三小时，这应该不是问题。</p>
<p>应避免只在烤箱中烤焦的软蛋白霜，因为蛋白没有正确煮熟，有沙门氏菌的潜在风险（见鸡蛋）。这意味着应避免自制柠檬蛋白派和烤阿拉斯加等甜点。否则，您可以使用巴氏杀菌蛋白，您可以在许多超市以粉末或冷藏盒的形式购买。</p>
<p><strong>牛奶 (Milk)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期饮用经过热处理杀死有害细菌的牛奶是安全的。这意味着您可以饮用巴氏杀菌、UHT、灭菌和奶粉。只要经过这些方式的热处理，饮用全脂牛奶、半脱脂牛奶、1%脂肪牛奶和脱脂牛奶都是安全的。同样，如果经过热处理，您可以用山羊奶或绵羊奶代替牛奶。饮用炼乳和甜炼乳也是安全的。</p>
<p>尽可能选择低脂选项，如脱脂或半脱脂牛奶。</p>
<p>最好避免饮用未经巴氏杀菌的牛奶（包括山羊奶和绵羊奶）并用于烹饪，因为它可能含有李斯特菌和其他细菌，如大肠杆菌和布鲁氏菌，这些都可能导致食物中毒。</p>
<p>另见有机牛奶。</p>
<p><strong>猴子坚果 (Monkey nuts)</strong></p>
<p>见花生。</p>
<p><strong>慕斯 (Mousse)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以安全食用从超市或大型零售商购买的慕斯。它含有的任何鸡蛋都应该是巴氏杀菌的。</p>
<p>自制慕斯通常含有生蛋，孕期应避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险（见鸡蛋）。</p>
<p><strong>马苏里拉奶酪 (Mozzarella)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用马苏里拉奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。无论是用巴氏杀菌还是未杀菌牛奶制成的披萨或其他热菜上的熟马苏里拉都是可以的。</p>
<p><strong>泥土 (Mud)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 如果您对泥土或泥土有强烈渴望，这是不应该满足的。通过吃泥土，即使只是非常泥泞的土豆，您也有弓形虫病、李斯特菌病和其他形式食物中毒的风险。见第16页关于异食癖的部分。</p>
<p><strong>贻贝 (Mussels)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果贻贝被正确烹饪并作为滚烫菜肴的一部分食用，如白葡萄酒贻贝、海鲜汤或鱼派，是可以食用的。罐装贻贝也是可以的。</p>
<p>最好避免冷食的贻贝，除非您确定它们是新鲜烹饪和冷却的。</p>
<p><strong>N</strong></p>
<p><strong>荨麻茶 (Nettle tea)</strong></p>
<p>荨麻叶含有几种维生素和矿物质，包括叶酸、铁和钙。然而，荨麻茶被发现几乎不含或完全不含这些营养素。一些草药师推荐荨麻茶用于孕期，声称它提供各种好处：增强肾脏、减少腿部抽筋和分娩疼痛以及预防痔疮。没有证据支持这一点，但孕期饮用荨麻茶通常被认为是安全的。</p>
<p><strong>亚硝酸盐 (Nitrites)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 硝酸盐和亚硝酸盐作为防腐剂（防止细菌生长）添加到腌制肉类和肉类产品中，并产生其特征性的粉红色或红色。它们通常添加到火腿、萨拉米、培根、咸牛肉和热狗中。要识别含有亚硝酸盐的食品，请在食品标签上查找硝酸钾、亚硝酸钾、硝酸钠、亚硝酸钠和硝石，或这些添加剂的E编号（E249至E252）。</p>
<p>人们对这些防腐剂表示担忧，因为它们在体内转化为亚硝基化合物。当给动物大剂量服用时，这些化合物已被证明会导致癌症，怀疑它们在人类中可能有相同的效果。一项研究发现，大量摄入腌制肉类的妇女（整个孕期每天超过100克）更有可能生下患有儿童脑肿瘤的孩子。其他类似研究没有发现相同的效果，但在孕期只适量食用腌制肉类和含有亚硝酸盐的类似产品似乎是明智的。不知道亚硝酸盐是否会传递到母乳中，因此哺乳期间也建议适量食用。</p>
<p><strong>肉豆蔻 (Nutmeg)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在正常烹饪中食用肉豆蔻是可以的，例如在蛋糕、饼干和米布丁中。</p>
<p>孕期应避免大量肉豆蔻粉和肉豆蔻油（有时用于芳香疗法）。这些可能导致孕妇产生幻觉和心悸以及胎儿心率加快。</p>
<p><strong>坚果 (Nuts)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期可以安全食用杏仁、巴西坚果、榛子、花生、山核桃、核桃和其他种类的坚果，除非您对它们过敏。这适用于您怀孕、备孕或哺乳期间。</p>
<p><strong>O</strong></p>
<p><strong>油性鱼 (Oily fish)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 根据FSA，孕妇、哺乳期妇女或备孕妇女每周应吃一到两份油性鱼。油性鱼，如三文鱼和沙丁鱼，富含有益的omega-3脂肪酸，提供蛋白质和必需的维生素和矿物质。然而，您不应该吃太多，因为油性鱼可能含有高水平的二恶英和多氯联苯（PCBs）。这些是在环境中广泛存在但在油性鱼中浓度更高的污染物。两者都不会立即影响健康，但高水平可能会在长期造成问题。</p>
<p>您不应该因此而不吃适量的油性鱼。二恶英和PCBs是无法完全避免的，因为它们存在于许多其他食物中，并在环境中广泛存在。由于对工业污染更严格的控制，过去20年来自饮食来源的暴露下降了约75%。此外，科学家发现，如果您每周食用一到两份油性鱼，其好处远远超过可能的风险。一些专家认为限量应该提高。布里斯托尔地区对5,000多名妇女的研究发现，当母亲在孕期每周食用超过340克海鲜（几乎是每周两份半）时，儿童的发育（包括三岁时的社会发展和绘画等技能的灵巧度评分以及八岁时的言语智商分数）受益最大。</p>
<p>见鱼、金枪鱼，以及第60页有关omega-3好处的更多信息。</p>
<p><strong>橄榄 (Olives)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以食用黑橄榄和绿橄榄，但它们往往含盐量很高，所以吃太多不是个好主意。购买橄榄时，最好买罐装或其他密封容器中的，而不是从熟食柜台购买，因为那里可能发生其他食品的细菌交叉污染。如果您与朋友分享一碗橄榄，食物中毒风险取决于其他人的卫生水平。</p>
<p><strong>Omega-3鸡蛋 (Omega 3 eggs)</strong></p>
<p>这些蛋含有比普通鸡蛋更多的有益长链omega-3脂肪酸，因为它们是由食用亚麻籽或其他富含短链omega-3饲料的鸡下的。Omega-3鸡蛋并非每个超市都有，但您可以从Sainsbury&rsquo;s、Waitrose或Ocado获得。两个鸡蛋提供约350毫克长链omega-3（DHA和EPA）。孕期食用是安全的，是提高长链omega-3摄入量的好方法，前提是将它们煮至蛋黄和蛋白凝固。另见鸡蛋。</p>
<p><strong>煎蛋卷 (Omelette)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用煎蛋卷，但要确保鸡蛋煮至完全凝固。特别是检查中心是否流动（见鸡蛋）。</p>
<p><strong>牛至 (Oregano)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期在烹饪中使用牛至是安全的。然而，当牛至添加到餐食中时，它会减少您身体吸收的铁量，因此最好不要经常使用，特别是如果您的铁水平低或处于边缘水平。</p>
<p>牛至油（用于芳香疗法）被认为是子宫刺激剂，孕期应避免。</p>
<p><strong>有机食品 (Organic food)</strong></p>
<p>食用有机食品可以减少您对化肥和农药残留的摄入。有机食品也不含转基因（GM）成分，并含有更小范围的食品添加剂。它可能还有更高水平的某些营养素和类黄酮，但这还没有牢固确立。</p>
<p>没有人知道孕期或哺乳期间食用有机食品是否真的对您的宝宝更好。有些人声称吃有机食品可以降低儿童癌症和早熟的风险，或有益于认知发展，但没有科学证据支持这一点。食品中使用的所有化学物质，包括喷洒在作物上的农药和添加到加工食品中的色素，都经过安全测试，没有任何迹象表明这些对婴儿的发育有害。然而，在过去60到100年里，数百种新化学物质被引入食品系统，没有人知道在未来几年可能会发现什么长期影响。许多女性选择吃有机食品作为预防措施，以减少她们以及因此她们的宝宝接触的化学物质量。</p>
<p>如果您吃有机食品，在食用前仍需要同样小心地清洗所有水果和蔬菜，以避免接触有害细菌。您还应该记住，仅仅因为某样东西是有机的，并不意味着它就是健康的。有机可乐仍然是含有咖啡因和其他一些添加剂的糖水，有机胡萝卜蛋糕和巧克力仍然不幸地含有大量卡路里。此外，有机食品产品不会添加额外的维生素和矿物质。因此，如果您吃有机早餐麦片等食品，您可能会减少某些营养素的摄入，如铁和B族维生素。</p>
<p><strong>有机牛奶 (Organic milk)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期或哺乳期饮用巴氏杀菌有机牛奶是安全的（有关更多信息，请参阅牛奶）。未经巴氏杀菌的有机牛奶有时在农场商店出售，但应该避免，因为有李斯特菌病和其他形式食物中毒的风险。2016年，一项对多项不同研究的综述发表，结论是总体而言有机牛奶中的omega-3脂肪酸水平高于传统牛奶。然而，牛奶含有短链omega-3，而不是油性鱼中发现的有益长链omega-3。</p>
<p>另一个要考虑的问题是，有机牛奶的碘含量比传统牛奶低约40%，反映了奶牛较低的碘摄入量。由于一些女性的碘水平较低（见第74页），而且牛奶和奶制品是碘的主要来源，这是一个重要问题。如果您食用有机牛奶和奶制品，确保您在饮食中有碘的替代来源尤为重要。</p>
<p><strong>阿华田 (Ovaltine)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全饮用阿华田。见麦芽热饮。</p>
<p><strong>生蚝 (Oysters)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 生蚝通常生吃，应该避免，因为有食物中毒风险。与其他生贝类一样，它们偶尔可能含有甲型肝炎（见贝类）。它们还可能含有一种叫做诺如病毒的病毒，可能导致恶心、腹泻、腹痛、头痛和发烧。</p>
<p><strong>P</strong></p>
<p><strong>木瓜 (Papaya/pawpaw)</strong></p>
<p>木瓜是维生素A（作为β-胡萝卜素）和维生素C的良好来源，孕期或哺乳期间没有必要避免。过去，特别是在亚洲部分地区，人们认为孕期吃木瓜可能导致流产。木瓜含有一种叫做木瓜蛋白酶的酶，可以分解蛋白质并帮助嫩化肉类。这可能与传统信仰有关，但没有证据表明正常食用会引起任何担忧。</p>
<p><strong>帕尔马火腿 (Parma ham)</strong></p>
<p>见腌制肉类。</p>
<p><strong>帕玛森奶酪 (Parmesan cheese)</strong></p>
<p>无论是用巴氏杀菌还是未杀菌牛奶制成的，孕期都被认为是安全食用的。这是因为它是酸性的，含水量低，所以不是李斯特菌等细菌生长的合适环境。</p>
<p><strong>欧芹 (Parsley)</strong></p>
<p>正常烹饪中可以安全食用。</p>
<p>应避免食用大量欧芹，因为这可能具有子宫刺激作用。</p>
<p><strong>肝酱 (Pâté)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 孕期应避免任何含有肝脏的肝酱，因为它含有高水平的维生素A（见肝脏）。其他类型的新鲜或冷藏肝酱，包括蔬菜肝酱，也应该避免，因为它们可能含有李斯特菌。</p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用罐装或管装肝酱，如Tartex或GranoVita，前提是它不含肝脏。应仔细遵循储存说明。</p>
<p>哺乳期可以安全食用所有类型的肝酱。</p>
<p><strong>帕芙洛娃 (Pavlova)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用帕芙洛娃，前提是蛋白霜从中心到外都煮至凝固。另见蛋白霜。</p>
<p><strong>花生酱 (Peanut butter)</strong></p>
<p>除非您对花生过敏，否则孕期被认为是安全食用的。见花生。</p>
<p><strong>花生 (Peanuts)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 也称为花生和猴子坚果。目前的政府建议是，如果您想在孕期或哺乳期吃花生，作为健康均衡饮食的一部分是可以的（见第41页）。</p>
<p><strong>薄荷茶 (Peppermint tea)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期饮用薄荷茶是安全的。一些女性发现它有助于缓解消化不良、胃灼热、恶心和孕吐。</p>
<p>有一些说法，虽然没有确切证据，大量饮用可能导致流产。作为预防措施，最好不要连续喝几杯非常浓的薄荷茶。</p>
<p><strong>意大利辣肉肠 (Pepperoni)</strong></p>
<p>见腌制肉类。</p>
<p><strong>费城奶酪 (Philadelphia cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用费城奶酪和其他品牌的奶油奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>菠萝 (Pineapple)</strong></p>
<p>您可能听说孕期应该避免菠萝，因为它可能导致流产，或者在孕晚期应该吃它来催产。事实是，在孕期任何阶段正常食用菠萝都极不可能产生任何影响。</p>
<p>新鲜菠萝含有一种叫做菠萝蛋白酶的酶，可以分解蛋白质。在高度浓缩的片剂形式中，菠萝蛋白酶用于治疗炎症。孕期不建议服用菠萝蛋白酶片剂或胶囊，因为它可能导致异常出血。然而，一些替代疗法师可能会在孕晚期推荐它们，以帮助宫颈软化和更容易扩张，尽管没有发现证据证明这是有效的。要从新鲜菠萝中获得足够的菠萝蛋白酶产生任何可能的效果，您需要一次吃7到10个新鲜菠萝。罐装菠萝和菠萝汁几乎不含或完全不含菠萝蛋白酶。</p>
<p><strong>松子 (Pine nuts/pine kernels)</strong></p>
<p>除非您对它们有特定过敏，否则松子可以安全食用。没有证据表明孕期或哺乳期间避免会降低您的孩子患坚果过敏或任何其他形式过敏的风险。</p>
<p><strong>披萨 (Pizza)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果所有配料都正确烹饪，通常可以安全食用任何种类的披萨。这包括用山羊奶酪、斯蒂尔顿、戈尔根佐拉和任何其他种类的奶酪制作的披萨，前提是它们被煮至滚烫。这些奶酪可能含有李斯特菌，但正确烹饪会将其杀死。</p>
<p>❌ 应避免加帕尔马火腿的披萨，因为火腿是在烹饪后添加的，有食物中毒风险（见腌制肉类）。</p>
<p><strong>波特萨卢奶酪 (Port Salut cheese)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用波特萨卢奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>土豆沙拉 (Potato salad)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以安全食用自制土豆沙拉，前提是用罐装蛋黄酱制作。超市和类似商店出售的商业制备土豆沙拉也可以安全食用。</p>
<p>孕期应避免用自制蛋黄酱制作的土豆沙拉，因为它含有生蛋，可能被沙门氏菌污染。来自熟食店的土豆沙拉以及在烧烤或自助餐桌上放置几个小时的任何土豆沙拉都应该避免，因为有李斯特菌风险。</p>
<p><strong>虾 (Prawns)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果虾被正确烹饪并作为热餐的一部分食用，例如在咖喱或炒菜中，是安全食用的。如果沙拉或三明治中的冷虾已经煮熟然后冷却并保持冷藏直到食用，应该是安全的。</p>
<p>如果您对冷虾的烹饪或储存方式有任何疑问，最好避免，因为有食物中毒风险（见贝类）。</p>
<p><strong>益生元 (Prebiotics)</strong></p>
<p>这些是不被直接消化但被大肠中所谓的&quot;友好细菌&quot;消耗的食品成分。它们帮助肠道中的有益细菌以牺牲潜在有害细菌为代价而繁殖。没有任何迹象表明孕期或哺乳期间不应食用益生元，如低聚半乳糖。到目前为止研究很少，但它们可能是有益的。</p>
<p><strong>益生菌 (Probiotics)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 这些是对健康有益的活微生物。孕期和哺乳期间饮用含有益生菌的产品是安全的。如果含有益生菌的食品或饮料不适合孕期，那么它应该带有警告说明。如果您考虑服用益生菌补充剂，而不是含有益生菌的食品或饮料，请仔细检查它含有哪些其他成分。一些益生菌补充剂除了益生菌外还包含维生素和矿物质，这些可能处于不适合孕期的水平。</p>
<p>有一些证据表明，在出生前后接触特定益生菌可以预防过敏（见第7页）。此外，孕期服用益生菌似乎有助于便秘和治疗阴道感染，这些感染有时与早产有关。</p>
<p><strong>泡芙 (Profiteroles)</strong></p>
<p>如果从超市、街头面包店或类似商店或餐厅购买，孕期被认为是安全食用的泡芙或巧克力闪电泡芙。它们含有鸡蛋，但这是在泡芙皮中煮熟的，奶油将是巴氏杀菌的，除非从获得许可出售自己未经巴氏杀菌牛奶和奶制品的农场商店购买。</p>
<p><strong>意式熏火腿 (Prosciutto)</strong></p>
<p>这是意大利语中火腿的意思，但在英语中通常指烟熏香料意大利火腿。意式熏火腿是腌制但未煮熟的，因此应该与其他腌制肉类以相同方式考虑。见腌制肉类。</p>
<p><strong>蛋白质奶昔 (Protein shakes)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期饮用蛋白质奶昔的长期影响尚未测试，因此不清楚它们是否安全。有不同类型的蛋白质奶昔。有些在标签上说不适合孕期，这些应该完全避免。其他蛋白质奶昔作为多样化健康饮食的一部分作为零食可能是可以的，但不宜将它们作为代餐。大多数女性已经摄入了足够的蛋白质，通过吃真正的食物和均衡饮食来满足蛋白质需求要好得多（见第12页）。这样您还会获得所需的所有维生素、矿物质和植物营养素，以及蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂肪的正确平衡。摄入过多蛋白质或蛋白质相对于其他营养素的不平衡对您的宝宝不好（见第27-28页）。</p>
<p><strong>梅干 (Prunes)</strong></p>
<p>梅干和梅干汁是便秘的古老疗法。它们的泻药作用不能完全用纤维来解释——梅干含有与其他干果相似量的纤维，而梅干汁完全不含纤维，因为它在装瓶前被过滤。独特的效果更可能是由于梅干含有高水平的山梨醇，这是一种吸收非常缓慢的糖类，可以像纤维一样进入大肠。梅干还含有大量酚类化合物，也可以产生天然泻药作用。</p>
<p><strong>普洱茶 (Pu-erh tea)</strong></p>
<p>据报道，这是帮助维多利亚·贝克汉姆恢复孕前身材的茶。归因于它的健康益处包括溶解脂肪和降低血液胆固醇水平的能力。没有证据支持这些说法或其他关于它提高新陈代谢和帮助减肥的信念。产后减肥的最佳方式是合理饮食和规律运动（见第182页）。此外，不建议在用餐时喝茶，因为它会减少您对急需的微量营养素的吸收，特别是铁。</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong></p>
<p><strong>乳蛋饼 (Quiche)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 商业制备的乳蛋饼孕期应该是安全食用的。如果您有任何疑问，不要冷食而是按照制造商的指南加热，并确保它整个都滚烫。自制乳蛋饼也应该仔细烹饪，以确保鸡蛋变得凝固（见鸡蛋）。</p>
<p><strong>奎宁 (Quinine)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 汤力水和苦柠檬含有奎宁，孕期适量饮用是可以的。奎宁是一种用于治疗疟疾的药物，关于孕期是否应该使用存在一些争议。然而，汤力水中的含量与疟疾治疗使用的量相比微不足道，所以除非您每天喝几瓶，否则没有必要担心。有一些说法认为奎宁有助于缓解夜间腿部抽筋。然而，如果您患有这种情况，最好不要自我治疗，而是与您的助产士或全科医生交谈。</p>
<p><strong>夸恩素肉 (Quorn)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 所有夸恩产品都含有真菌蛋白，适合素食者。与来自大豆的豆腐不同，真菌蛋白是真菌家族的一部分，像蘑菇一样。夸恩产品是植物蛋白的良好来源，脂肪含量低，还提供纤维。没有任何迹象表明夸恩产品不适合孕期或哺乳期间。</p>
<p><strong>R</strong></p>
<p><strong>覆盆子叶茶 (Raspberry leaf tea)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在孕晚期服用覆盆子叶茶被认为有助于为分娩做好准备。覆盆子叶可以作为茶和片剂形式从大多数健康食品店购买。覆盆子叶是子宫刺激剂，被认为可以增强子宫肌肉，这样当您有宫缩时，它们更有效，分娩更容易。在澳大利亚的一项研究中，从怀孕32周开始，女性每天服用两片覆盆子叶补充剂（每片1.2克）。第二产程（推出婴儿）平均比那些接受安慰剂的女性短10分钟。她们的产钳分娩率也更低（19%对30%）。没有证据表明覆盆子叶茶会引发分娩，即使您的宝宝过期了。</p>
<p>不建议在怀孕约32周之前服用覆盆子叶茶，因为您不希望在宝宝准备好出生之前刺激子宫肌肉。</p>
<p><strong>红牛 (Red Bull)</strong></p>
<p>见能量饮料。</p>
<p><strong>红酒酱 (Red wine sauce)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期或哺乳期间可以安全食用红酒肉汁和红酒炖梨等食品。一份食物所含的酒精量非常少，不值得担心。大多数食谱使用的酒很少，而且大部分酒精都被煮掉了。据估计，烹饪15分钟后，60%的酒精会流失；一小时后，75%会流失。</p>
<p><strong>米饭 (Rice)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 一般来说，吃米饭是安全的，但要注意米饭沙拉和含有重新加热米饭的菜肴，如印度香饭、印度香饭和蛋炒饭。米饭可能含有蜡样芽孢杆菌的孢子，如果菜肴在室温下放置，孢子就会萌发。米饭放置的时间越长，这些细菌繁殖得越多。细菌产生的毒素可能导致食物中毒（呕吐和腹泻）。不知道蜡样芽孢杆菌在孕期是否有任何其他影响。</p>
<p>最好吃刚煮好的米饭。或者，应该在一小时内冷却，存放在冰箱中，并在24小时内食用。重新加热米饭时，确保它整个都滚烫。</p>
<p><strong>瑞可塔奶酪 (Ricotta)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用瑞可塔奶酪，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。</p>
<p><strong>罗克福奶酪 (Roquefort cheese)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 这是一种软蓝纹奶酪，孕期应避免，因为有李斯特菌风险。</p>
<p>如果菜肴煮至滚烫，如罗克福酱配牛排，可以安全食用，因为这会杀死任何存在的李斯特菌。</p>
<p><strong>S</strong></p>
<p><strong>糖精 (Saccharin)</strong></p>
<p>见人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>鼠尾草 (Sage)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期或哺乳期间食用含有鼠尾草的食物是可以的。鼠尾草被认为具有类似雌激素的作用，大量服用时可能刺激子宫，因此孕期应避免鼠尾草油（用于芳香疗法）。如果您正在哺乳，请避免鼠尾草茶，因为它可能干扰乳汁生产。然而，如果您想停止母乳喂养，喝鼠尾草茶可能有助于减少您产生的乳汁量，从而减轻任何不适。</p>
<p><strong>沙拉 (Salad)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 沙拉是健康的选择，但重要的是所有成分都要彻底清洗，以降低食物中毒风险。袋装购买的预包装沙拉也应该清洗，即使它标注为已清洗和即食。这是因为这种袋子偶尔被发现被李斯特菌或沙门氏菌污染。</p>
<p>如果您在外面吃饭，特别是如果您在国外旅行，除非您对卫生水平完全有信心，否则最好避免沙拉。</p>
<p>另见卷心菜沙拉和土豆沙拉。</p>
<p><strong>萨拉米 (Salami)</strong></p>
<p>见腌制肉类。</p>
<p><strong>三文鱼 (Salmon)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 三文鱼提供蛋白质、铁、维生素B6、B12和D，以及对宝宝有益的长链omega-3。然而，由于所有油性鱼都含有微量污染物，建议每周不要超过两份。关于养殖或野生三文鱼哪个更好有一些猜测，但FSA得出结论，两者之间没有显著差异。发现野生三文鱼比养殖三文鱼含有更高水平的omega-3，但也含有更高水平的污染物。</p>
<p>另见烟熏三文鱼、腌三文鱼和油性鱼。</p>
<p><strong>三明治 (Sandwiches)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在家制作三明治时，记得清洗任何沙拉配料。如果您购买三明治，去一家您信任卫生水平的商店或餐厅。选择预包装三明治可能比在熟食柜台准备的三明治更好，因为熟食柜台更容易发生交叉污染。</p>
<p>以下三明治都应该是安全食用的：奶酪和泡菜、普劳曼（ploughman&rsquo;s）、蛋黄酱鸡蛋、火腿沙拉、金枪鱼玉米、鸡肉、鹰嘴豆泥、水煮三文鱼。如果您对三明治的储存方式有任何疑问，例如从准备时是否一直冷藏，最好避免虾蛋黄酱、蟹或小龙虾三明治。</p>
<p>应避免布里奶酪或山羊奶酪（Chèvre）三明治。</p>
<p><strong>沙丁鱼 (Sardines)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 这是一种油性鱼，是长链omega-3、铁、锌和维生素B12的良好来源。一罐沙丁鱼约含三分之二份油性鱼。因此，如果您不吃任何其他油性鱼，每周最多可以吃三罐沙丁鱼。</p>
<p><strong>沙爹酱 (Satay/saté)</strong></p>
<p>沙爹猪肉、羊肉或鸡肉等菜肴是用花生酱制作的。除非您有花生过敏，否则没有必要避免沙爹菜肴或任何其他含有花生的食物。见花生。</p>
<p><strong>扇贝 (Scallops)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用熟扇贝，但不应生吃。</p>
<p><strong>炒蛋 (Scrambled egg)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以安全食用炒蛋。然而，确保您将鸡蛋煮熟。如果它们稍微流动，就有沙门氏菌风险。见鸡蛋。</p>
<p><strong>海鲜 (Seafood)</strong></p>
<p>见贝类。</p>
<p><strong>海鲜棒 (Seafood sticks)</strong></p>
<p>有时被称为蟹棒或鱼棒。它们通常由加工过的白鱼和蟹味调味料等其他添加剂制成。只要保持冷藏，它们应该是安全食用的。</p>
<p><strong>海藻 (Seaweed)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 紫菜、裙带菜、昆布、海带和其他类型的海藻碘含量极高。您需要注意食用的海藻类型和数量，否则您可能很容易摄入过多的碘，这可能干扰甲状腺功能（见第75页）。英国饮食协会建议孕妇每周不要吃海藻超过一次，不要服用海藻或海藻提取物制成的补充剂（见第86页）。</p>
<p><strong>贝类 (Shellfish)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 如果彻底煮熟并作为热餐的一部分食用，孕期可以食用贝类（包括虾、蛤蜊、扇贝、贻贝、小龙虾、海螺和小虾）。例如，您可以在鱼派、咖喱或炒菜中食用贝类。</p>
<p>新鲜烹饪和冷却的贝类（如虾或蟹）也可以安全食用。这意味着如果从信誉良好的商店购买且您确信它们一直保持冷藏，虾三明治等产品是可以的。</p>
<p>通常生吃的贝类，如生蚝、海螺和蛤蜊，应该避免，因为它们可能被有害细菌和病毒污染，包括影响肝脏的甲型肝炎。症状包括恶心、腹痛、疲劳、发烧、深色尿液和黄疸。</p>
<p>如果您对烹饪或储存方式有任何疑问，最好也避免煮熟但冷食的贝类，例如虾三明治和蟹或龙虾沙拉。</p>
<p>另见蟹。</p>
<p><strong>烟熏鱼 (Smoked fish)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在英国，孕期食用烟熏鱼被认为是安全的，包括烟熏三文鱼、烟熏鲭鱼和烟熏鳟鱼。在美国和澳大利亚，建议孕妇不要吃烟熏鱼，除非是热的，因为有李斯特菌的潜在危险。然而，在英国，与布里奶酪和肝酱等食品相比，风险较低。话虽如此，在2013年和2014年，FSA召回了几批烟熏三文鱼，因为发现它们含有李斯特菌，2015年召回了一批，因为担心肉毒杆菌。</p>
<p>另一个让一些女性担忧的问题是烟熏鱼的多环芳烃（PAH）含量。由于海洋污染和烟熏过程，PAHs存在。大多数PAHs食用是安全的，但有些被认为是致癌的。发现传统烟熏窑烟熏的鱼中致癌PAHs苯并(a)芘的水平高于大型商业烟熏窑烟熏的鱼。烟熏三文鱼和其他烟熏鱼中的盐含量通常也很高，比普通鱼高得多。这些问题并不意味着烟熏鱼完全不能吃，因为风险并不真正清楚。然而，最好适量食用烟熏鱼（有关份量限制，请参阅油性鱼），每天都吃烟熏三文鱼百吉饼来满足每日渴望可能不是一个好主意。</p>
<p><strong>烟熏鲭鱼 (Smoked mackerel)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在英国，孕期食用烟熏鲭鱼被认为是安全的（有关份量限制，请参阅油性鱼）。另见烟熏鱼。</p>
<p><strong>烟熏三文鱼 (Smoked salmon)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在英国，孕期食用烟熏三文鱼被认为是安全的（有关份量限制，请参阅油性鱼）。另见腌三文鱼和烟熏鱼。</p>
<p><strong>蜗牛 (Snails)</strong></p>
<p>见蜗牛。</p>
<p><strong>软奶酪 (Soft cheese)</strong></p>
<p>见奶酪。</p>
<p><strong>酸奶油 (Sour cream)</strong></p>
<p>孕期可以食用酸奶油，前提是用巴氏杀菌牛奶制成。用未经巴氏杀菌牛奶制成的酸奶油只能直接从农场获得，应该避免。</p>
<p><strong>大豆 (Soya)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 作为正常健康饮食的一部分，食用大豆或豆腐和豆浆等产品没有问题。人们对大豆可能对胎儿发育产生的不良影响表示担忧，但这些并没有充分根据。大豆含有一种叫做染料木黄酮的植物雌激素，可以产生与激素雌激素类似但更弱的作用。研究表明，当怀孕的老鼠食用富含染料木黄酮的饮食时，可能会影响其婴儿未来的生育能力。有人猜测，富含大豆的饮食可能对人类有类似影响，但没有证据支持这一点。</p>
<p>一项研究发现，尿道下裂（阴茎缺陷）在素食母亲的婴儿中更常见，有人认为这可能与较高的植物雌激素摄入有关。然而，大豆摄入量高的国家，如中国和日本，似乎没有这样的问题。因此，证据的平衡表明正常消费是可以的。</p>
<p><strong>辛辣食物 (Spicy food)</strong></p>
<p>孕期食用咖喱和辣椒等辛辣食物是可以的，只要您吃的时候感觉还好。如果您吃的食物太辣，它可能刺激肠道内壁并产生泻药作用。这极不可能对您的宝宝产生严重影响，但对您来说会很不舒服，还会让您脱水。</p>
<p>有时有人建议吃热咖喱可以催产，但这没有得到证实（见第100页）。</p>
<p><strong>菠菜 (Spinach)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 可以安全食用，是β-胡萝卜素、叶酸和维生素C的良好来源。然而，菠菜是铁的良好来源是一个误解：菠菜含有草酸，它与铁紧密结合，使大部分铁无法被吸收。</p>
<p><strong>Splenda</strong></p>
<p>见人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>鞑靼牛排 (Steak tartar/steak Americaine)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 孕期绝对不能吃。它含有生肉，可能感染弓形虫病，还有生蛋，因此也有沙门氏菌风险。</p>
<p><strong>甜菊糖 (Stevia)</strong></p>
<p>见人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>斯蒂尔顿奶酪 (Stilton)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 这是一种蓝纹奶酪，但FSA认为孕期可以安全食用，因为它是硬的。这意味着它不像软奶酪那样含有那么多水分，所以细菌很难在里面生长。然而，最好检查包装，因为斯蒂尔顿在成熟时间上有所不同，这会影响其盐和水分含量，进而影响其安全性。因此，尽管有一般建议，您不应该吃带有警告说孕妇应该避免的奶酪，因为这将基于制造商的具体配方。</p>
<p><strong>三氯蔗糖 (Sucralose)</strong></p>
<p>见人工甜味剂。</p>
<p><strong>亚硫酸盐 (Sulphites)</strong></p>
<p>如果您通常食用含有亚硫酸盐的食品和饮料，孕期没有理由避免它们。亚硫酸盐是添加剂（编号E220至E228），用于保存食物和防止变色或变褐，用于干杏和晒干番茄等产品中。它们也存在于香肠、汉堡、软饮料和葡萄酒中。有些人对亚硫酸盐敏感，接触后可能会哮喘发作。因此，任何含有亚硫酸盐的食品或饮料都带有警告以提醒这些人。没有证据表明应该避免，除非您对它们过敏或患有哮喘。</p>
<p><strong>葵花籽 (Sunflower seeds)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 这是铁、锌和维生素A的良好来源，孕期可以安全食用。虽然适量食用葵花籽是可以的，但大量食用可能不是一个好主意。这是因为它们富含亚油酸（LA），这是一种omega-6脂肪酸。高摄入omega-6脂肪酸可能干扰omega-3脂肪酸的代谢，而omega-3脂肪酸在孕期特别有益（见第59页）。</p>
<p><strong>寿司 (Sushi)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 生养殖鱼在孕期被认为是安全食用的，但生野生鱼在食用前必须冷冻。冷冻会杀死野生鱼中可能存在的任何微小寄生虫，否则可能会让您生病。送到商店或餐厅的现成寿司应该是安全的，因为食品安全法规规定它必须在−20°C下冷冻24小时。自己准备新鲜寿司的餐厅可能没有这样做，所以请向工作人员确认。如果您在家里做寿司，在使用前至少将鱼冷冻四天。</p>
<p><strong>剑鱼 (Swordfish)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 剑鱼中发现了高水平的汞，建议孕妇完全不要食用。如果您正在哺乳，建议每周可以食用一份但不能更多。</p>
<p><strong>T</strong></p>
<p><strong>鱼子酱沙拉 (Taramasalata)</strong></p>
<p>FSA认为商业制备的鱼子酱沙拉孕期可以安全食用。</p>
<p><strong>塔塔酱 (Tartar sauce)</strong></p>
<p>罐装或袋装塔塔酱可以安全食用，因为这是用巴氏杀菌蛋制成的。</p>
<p>自制塔塔酱通常以与自制蛋黄酱相同的方式制作，在这种情况下，它将含有生蛋并有沙门氏菌风险。然而，它也可以用煮熟的蛋黄制作，这是安全的，所以最好询问。</p>
<p><strong>茶 (Tea)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 适量饮用普通红茶是可以的。然而，每杯含有约50毫克咖啡因，因此孕期每天不应超过约四杯。如果您喜欢浓茶并且喝大杯，那么咖啡因含量会更高。此外，如果您还喝咖啡和可乐，那么您应该喝更少的茶（见第50页）。您可以尝试无咖啡因茶、薄荷茶或果茶等替代品。</p>
<p>尽量避免在用餐时或饭后立即喝茶（普通或无咖啡因），因为它会大大减少铁的吸收。茶中的多酚，称为单宁，与早餐麦片和面包等食物中的铁紧密结合，所以铁未被吸收就通过您的消化系统。同样，如果您正在服用铁补充剂或含铁的复合维生素，服用后约一小时内避免喝茶。</p>
<p>另见绿茶、草药茶、薄荷茶、普洱茶和覆盆子叶茶。</p>
<p><strong>百里香 (Thyme)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 在普通烹饪中使用百里香是可以的。</p>
<p>孕期应避免大量药用百里香和百里香精油，因为它被认为是子宫刺激剂。</p>
<p><strong>提拉米苏 (Tiramisu)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 孕期可以安全食用从超市或类似商店购买的提拉米苏。它含有的任何鸡蛋和奶油都将是巴氏杀菌的，如果它含有酒精和咖啡，这些量非常少，不用担心。</p>
<p>自制提拉米苏的奶油配料中可能含有生蛋，因此应该避免，因为有沙门氏菌风险。它还可能含有相当多的酒精和浓咖啡，需要考虑在内。</p>
<p><strong>豆腐 (Tofu)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期和哺乳期间食用豆腐是可以的。另见大豆。</p>
<p><strong>汤力水 (Tonic water)</strong></p>
<p>孕期饮用汤力水是安全的。见奎宁。</p>
<p><strong>金枪鱼 (Tuna)</strong></p>
<p>⚠️ 适量食用金枪鱼是安全的。建议孕期每周不要超过两份新鲜金枪鱼（每份140克）或四罐200克罐头。如果您一周吃了四罐金枪鱼，您仍然可以吃两份油性鱼，如三文鱼或鲭鱼，但不能是新鲜金枪鱼。</p>
<p>新鲜金枪鱼是油性鱼，提供对宝宝发育有益的长链omega-3。然而，它也可能含有污染物（二恶英和多氯联苯）。罐装金枪鱼不被认为是油性鱼，因为在罐装过程中大部分油被分离和流失。因此，罐装金枪鱼的脂肪酸组成与白鱼相似。这意味着罐装金枪鱼不是长链omega-3的良好来源，就多氯联苯而言也不是问题。然而，由于新鲜和罐装金枪鱼都被发现含有汞，它们只应适量食用。</p>
<p>哺乳期间对金枪鱼的食用量没有限制。</p>
<p><strong>V</strong></p>
<p><strong>鹿肉 (Venison)</strong></p>
<p>见野味。</p>
<p><strong>W</strong></p>
<p><strong>水 (Water)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 所有成年人每天需要喝至少六到八杯液体。孕期您可能会注意到自己变得更渴。母乳喂养绝对是非常容易口渴的工作。如果天气热或您在运动，您需要更多液体。由于孕期不建议饮酒，咖啡因摄入量应受限，水是您饮食的重要组成部分。自来水与瓶装水一样好，其质量受到密切监测。</p>
<p><strong>葡萄酒 (Wine)</strong></p>
<p>❌ 不建议孕期饮用葡萄酒。有关酒精的信息，请参阅第49页。</p>
<p><strong>Y</strong></p>
<p><strong>酸奶 (Yogurt)</strong></p>
<p>✅ 孕期可以安全食用酸奶。这包括描述为&quot;生物酸奶&quot;或含有&quot;活性菌&quot;的产品。它们含有的细菌是益生菌或&quot;健康细菌&quot;，因此不会导致食物中毒。</p>
<p>孕期不应食用用未经巴氏杀菌牛奶制成的酸奶，因为它可能含有李斯特菌或其他细菌，这可能导致食物中毒。在英国，这只能从农场商店获得。</p>
