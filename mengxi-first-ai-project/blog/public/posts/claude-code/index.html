PAGE: ages/0-12-months.html - &#34;👶 Baby: Discovering the World&#34;

INTRO SECTION:
&#34;In the first year, your baby&#39;s brain makes 1 million neural connections every second. 
The most important thing you can do? Be present, responsive, and talk to your baby.&#34;
— Based on research from Dr. John Medina, &#34;Brain Rules for Baby&#34;

WHAT BABIES ARE LEARNING:
- Trust and attachment (foundation for all learning)
- How their body works (motor development)
- Language sounds (even before speaking)
- Cause and effect (I cry → someone comes)
- Object permanence (things exist when hidden)

ACTIVITIES BY DEVELOPMENT AREA:

Language &amp; Connection (0-12 months):
1. &#34;Narrate Your Day&#34;
   - What: Talk through everything you do
   - Why: Babies learn language by hearing 21,000 words/day

2. &#34;Face Time (Not the App)&#34;
   - What: Get close (8-12 inches), make eye contact, make expressions
   - Why: Babies are born to study faces; it builds social brain
   - How: Smile, stick out tongue, raise eyebrows - pause and watch baby respond
   - Research: Newborns prefer faces over any other visual pattern

3. &#34;Singing Anything&#34;
   - What: Sing to your baby - any song
   - Why: Musical patterns help language development
   - How: Nursery rhymes, pop songs, made-up songs about diaper changes
   - Parent tip: Your voice is your baby&#39;s favorite sound, even if you can&#39;t sing

Math Foundations (0-12 months):

   - What: Use size words during play
   - Why: Comparison is foundation of mathematical thinking
   - How: &#34;Here&#39;s the BIG ball. Here&#39;s the small ball.&#34;

Sensory &amp; Motor (0-12 months):
1. &#34;Texture Exploration&#34;
   - What: Let baby touch different safe textures
   - Materials: Soft blanket, smooth spoon, bumpy ball, fuzzy toy
   - Why: Sensory input builds neural pathways
   - Safety: Always supervise; nothing small enough to choke on

2. &#34;Tummy Time Talking&#34;
   - What: Get on floor during tummy time, face-to-face
   - Why: Builds neck/core strength AND connection
   - How: Put interesting toy or your face at baby&#39;s eye level
   - Parent tip: Short sessions (3-5 min) multiple times daily

DEVELOPMENTAL NOTE BOX:
&#34;Every baby develops at their own pace. These activities aren&#39;t tests - 
they&#39;re invitations to connect. If your baby isn&#39;t interested, try again another day.&#34;

When they drop food from the highchair repeatedly, they&#39;re learning about gravity and cause-effect.&#34;
— Dr. Alison Gopnik, &#34;The Scientist in the Crib&#34;

WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN THEIR BRAIN:
- Language explosion (50 words → 200+ words this year)
- Walking opens up the world
- Independence vs. needing you (&#34;Me do it!&#34;)
- Testing limits (not being &#34;bad&#34; - learning boundaries)
- Parallel play (playing near, not with, other children)

ACTIVITIES:

Language Explosion (12-24 months):

PAGE: resources/milestones.html - &#34;Development Guide&#34;

IMPORTANT FRAMING:
&#34;This is a gentle guide, NOT a checklist. Every child develops at their own pace.
Wide variation is normal. If you have concerns, talk to your pediatrician.
These are averages, not requirements.&#34;

Organize by age and domain (physical, cognitive, language, social-emotional)
Include &#34;some children might also&#34; for advanced skills
Include &#34;talk to your doctor if concerned about&#34; for red flags
Emphasize that ranges are wide and normal

PAGE: about.html - &#34;About Little Learners Hub&#34;

SECTIONS:

Why This Site Exists:
&#34;I created Little Learners Hub while preparing to teach my own child.
As a new parent, I was overwhelmed by conflicting advice. 
I wanted to find what actually works — based on research, not marketing.

This site shares what I learned from child development scientists, 
educators, and researchers. No gimmicks, no expensive programs. 
Just simple, research-based ways to support your child&#39;s learning 
through the most powerful tools we have: play, conversation, and love.&#34;

Our Philosophy:
- Play is the work of childhood
- Relationships are the foundation of all learning
- Every child develops at their own pace
- Parents are their child&#39;s first and most important teacher
- Learning happens in everyday moments
- Less stuff, more presence

The Research Behind This Site:
Based on work from:
- Harvard Center on the Developing Child
- Yale Child Study Center
- Stanford DREME Project
- Temple University Infant Lab
- University of Washington Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences

Sources include books by Dr. Alison Gopnik, Dr. Daniel Siegel, 
Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, Dr. John Medina, Dr. Tovah Klein, and others.

            &lt;cite&gt;— 基于Dr. John Medina《婴儿大脑规则》的研究&lt;/cite&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;信任和依恋（所有学习的基础）&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;身体如何运作（运动发展）&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;语言声音（甚至在说话之前）&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;为什么：&lt;/strong&gt;婴儿通过每天听21,000个词学习语言&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;为什么：&lt;/strong&gt;将数字词汇与数量和爱的触摸联系起来&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;如何：&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;一个吻，两个吻，三个吻在你肚子上！&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
