# Critical Issues Diagnostic Report
**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Status:** Live Environment Assessment

## 🚨 Phase 1: Feature Audit

| Feature | Status | Criticality | Issue Found | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timeline View** | 🔴 **FAIL** | High | Data sync script (`obsidian-sync.py`) was detached from the main deployment pipeline. Timeline was showing stale data. | **FIXED**: Added execution step to `sync-and-publish.sh`. |
| **Search Function** | 🟢 **PASS** | High | Index generation and frontend logic are fully operational. | N/A |
| **Curated Content** | 🟢 **PASS** | Medium | Logic correctly filters and serves top 10 long-reads. | N/A |
| **Blog Listing** | 🟢 **PASS** | High | Card layout works; Expand/Collapse is functional. | N/A |
| **Upload System** | 🟡 **WARN** | Low | Client-side only. Relies on external Cloudflare Worker availability. No local failover. | Monitor Worker health. |

## 📐 Phase 2: Responsive Analysis

### Breakpoint Assessment
*   **Mobile (< 768px)**:
    *   **Navigation**: Improved with horizontal scrolling. No longer hidden.
    *   **Tables**: Full width overflow scrolling active. No layout breakage.
    *   **Code Blocks**: Horizontal scrolling active. No text wrapping issues.
*   **Tablet/Desktop (> 768px)**:
    *   **Layout**: `max-width: 1200px` container centering works.
    *   **Cards**: Grid layout (`minmax(300px, 1fr)`) scales correctly.

### CSS Optimization
*   **Dark Mode**: Verified `prefers-color-scheme: dark` support.
    *   *Observation*: Table borders in dark mode needed high contrast. (Fixed in previous step).
*   **Touch Targets**: Mobile navigation links now have adequate spacing.

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Strategic Review

### Architecture Assessment
**Current Flow:**
`Obsidian` -> `Python Script` -> `Hugo Content` -> `HTML Build` -> `Cloudflare`

**Strengths:**
*   **Ownership**: Full control over data transformation.
*   **Performance**: Static HTML is blazing fast.
*   **Cost**: Free hosting (Cloudflare Pages).

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Complexity**: Two separate Python scripts maintenance (`obsidian_to_hugo.py` vs `obsidian-sync.py`).
*   **Image Pipeline**: Currently disabled/stripped. R2 upload logic exists but is bypassed.

### Recommendations (Long-Term)
1.  **Merge Scripts**: Consolidate `obsidian-sync.py` functionality into `obsidian_to_hugo.py` to create a single "Source of Truth" processor.
2.  **Enable Image Hosting**: Re-enable R2 uploads for a richer content experience once text-only stability is proven.
3.  **Automated Testing**: Add a simple local HTTP check in `sync-and-publish.sh` to fail the build if `localhost:1313` returns 404s (e.g., using `curl`).
