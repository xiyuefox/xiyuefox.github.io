<p>Fun, simple activities for all ages and learning areas</p>
<div class="card">
<h3>Play Activity Library</h3>
<div class="activity">
<h4>Texture Treasure Basket</h4>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 6-12 months | <strong>Time:</strong> 10-15 minutes | <strong>Materials:</strong> Household items</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Place the basket within your baby's reach during tummy time or floor play. Watch as they explore each item with their hands, mouth, and eyes. Narrate their discoveries: "You found the soft scarf! It's so smooth on your hands."</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Supports sensory development, fine motor skills, and language development as they learn new words for textures and objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="activity">
<h4>Cardboard Box Town</h4>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 2-5 years | <strong>Time:</strong> 20-30 minutes | <strong>Materials:</strong> Large cardboard boxes, markers, crayons, tape, scissors, small toy people/cars</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Turn boxes into buildings (house, store, hospital) by cutting doors and windows. Let your child decorate them with markers. Set up the "town" on the floor and play together: "Let's take the toy car to the store to buy groceries!"</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Encourages imaginative play, creativity, and problem-solving. Promotes language skills through storytelling and social interaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="activity">
<h4>Pasta Sorting</h4>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 18-36 months | <strong>Time:</strong> 5-10 minutes | <strong>Materials:</strong> Two bowls, different types of pasta (penne, farfalle, rotini), optional: tongs or spoons</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Mix two types of pasta in one bowl. Show your child how to sort them into separate bowls: "Let's put all the bowtie pasta in this bowl and the penne in that one." For older toddlers, use tongs to practice fine motor skills.</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Builds early math skills (sorting, classification), fine motor skills, and concentration.</p>
</div>
<div class="activity">
<h4>Water Play Station</h4>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 1-5 years | <strong>Time:</strong> 15-20 minutes | <strong>Materials:</strong> Large bowl or bin, water, cups, spoons, funnels, squirt bottles, plastic toys</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Set up the water station on a towel or outside. Let your child pour water between cups, use funnels, and squirt water. Add ice cubes for extra fun: "Watch the ice melt in the warm water!"</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Teaches science concepts (volume, temperature, cause and effect) while developing hand-eye coordination and sensory skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="activity">
<h4>Story Stones</h4>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5 years | <strong>Time:</strong> 10-15 minutes | <strong>Materials:</strong> Smooth stones, paint, markers, clear sealant (optional)</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Paint simple pictures on stones (sun, cat, house, car, tree). Once dry, put all stones in a bag. Take turns pulling out stones and creating a story together: "Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a big tree..."</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Enhances storytelling skills, creativity, and language development. Encourages turn-taking and collaboration.</p>
