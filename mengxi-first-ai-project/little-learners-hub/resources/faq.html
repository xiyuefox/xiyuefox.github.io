<h1>Common Questions</h1>
<div class="card">
<h3>How much screen time is okay for young children?</h3>
<p>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics: For children 0-18 months, no screen time except video chatting with family. For 18-24 months, limited screen time (1 hour or less) with high-quality content. For 2-5 years, 1 hour or less per day. It's best to co-view and talk about what you're watching together to enhance learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>When should my child start talking?</h3>
<p>Every child develops at their own pace, but most children say their first words around 12 months and have a vocabulary of 50+ words by 18 months. By 2 years, they should be combining words into short sentences like "more milk." If you're concerned about your child's language development, talk to their pediatrician.</p>

<h3>How can I encourage my child to play independently?</h3>
<p>Start with short periods (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase. Set up a safe play space with open-ended toys (blocks, dolls, art supplies). Model play first, then step back and let them explore. Praise their efforts: "You're doing such a good job building that tower!"</p>

<h3>What's the difference between gross motor and fine motor skills?</h3>
<p>Gross motor skills involve large muscle groups (arms, legs, core) and include skills like walking, running, and climbing. Fine motor skills involve small, precise movements of the hands and fingers, like picking up small objects, using a spoon, or scribbling with a crayon.</p>

<div class="card">
<h3>How can I handle temper tantrums?</h3>
<p>Stay calm and validate their feelings: "I see you're angry because you can't have the cookie." Offer a safe space to calm down. For older toddlers, distract or redirect their attention. Remember that tantrums are normal at this age and will decrease as they learn to use words to express their feelings.</p>
